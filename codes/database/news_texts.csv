"Shiba Inu Investors Now Hold This New Cryptocurrency That Positioned To 1000x
Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had a remarkable journey in the cryptocurrency market, capturing the imagination of investors with its meteoric rise. However, recent trends have shown a more volatile and challenging path for the once high-flying meme coin. Despite increased token burns, which surged by 2,400% in the last 24 hours, the price of SHIB has fallen to $0.00001579, marking a 4% decline over the past week. This has led to growing concerns among investors about the token’s ability to reach the coveted $1 mark.
Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Current Market Position
Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a significant player in the meme coin market, with a substantial community and market presence. However, the token’s recent performance has been less than stellar, leading many to question its long-term viability.

Investors who once held high hopes for SHIB are now looking for alternative investments that promise more stability and potential for growth.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to grapple with market volatility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is steadily gaining ground.

"Cautious car buyers blamed for 10 per cent drop in car finance deals
Cautious car buyers blamed for 10 per cent drop in car finance deals
“Challenging conditions” have been blamed for a downturn in car finance, but the outlook is brighter, say lenders
Private buyers are taking out fewer finance agreements for new car purchases, with some switching to salary-sacrifice schemes to buy electric cars, and others seemingly waiting for an improvement in the wider economic environment before investing in new wheels.
June figures just released by the Finance & Leasing Association say new car finance deals for consumers are down by around 11 per cent by volume, and 10 per cent by value compared to the same month in 2023. Overall, in the first half of 2023, the decline has been only three per cent, implying that consumers are becoming more reluctant to take on new credit arrangements, rather than gaining in confidence.
It’s not just a trend affecting new cars either, with the FLA also reporting that the value of June’s used car finance deals slumped by 13 per cent year-on-year, while the volume of new business fell by 10 per cent.
The FLA’s chief economist Geraldine Kilkelly described the falls “modest” in the face of challenging conditions.
“The fall in the consumer new car finance market reflects trends in private new car sales and the shift by consumers to using salary-sacrifice schemes to finance new battery-electric vehicle purchases,” she says. The FLA forecasts the year will end with only a marginal drop in the value of the car finance market overall, with new car finance up one per cent and used finance down three per cent.
AA Car Finance director Mark Attwell agrees that the current slump doesn’t greatly affect the longer-term outlook. “While inflation is easing, many consumers remain cautious about making significant purchases such as cars or homes. However, the Bank of England's decision to lower the base rate could boost consumer confidence in the coming months, and help to reinvigorate the car finance market,” he says.
According to Attwell, with inflation under control and the possibility of a further interest-rate cut, the business anticipates a resurgence in finance-backed sales.

"A 'soft landing' is still on the table, economists say
Recession fears led to a sharp stock-market selloff in recent days, with the S&P 500 index posting a 3% loss Monday, its worst in almost two years.
Weaker-than-expected job data on Friday fueled concerns that the U.S. economy is on shaky footing, and that the Federal Reserve may have erred in its goal of achieving a so-called ""soft landing.""
A soft landing would mean the Fed charted a path with its interest-rate policy that tamed inflation without triggering an economic downturn.
Federal data on Friday showed a sharp jump in the U.S. unemployment rate. Investors worried this signaled a ""hard landing"" was becoming more likely.
However, the odds of a recession starting within the next year are still relatively low, economists said.
In other words, a soft landing is still in the cards, they said.
""I think far and away the most likely scenario is a soft landing: The economy avoids an economic downturn,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's.
Likewise, Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo Economics, said a soft landing remains his ""base case"" forecast.
But recession worries aren't totally unfounded due to some signs of economic weakness, he said.
""I think the fears are real,"" he said. ""I wouldn't discount them.""
Avoiding recession would also require the Fed to soon start cutting interest rates, Zandi and Bryson said.
If borrowing costs remain high, it increases the danger of a recession, they said.
Why are people freaking out?
The ""big shock"" on Friday — and a root cause of the ensuing stock-market rout — came from the monthly jobs report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bryson said.
The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July, up from 4.1% in June and 3.5% a year earlier, it showed.
A 4.3% national jobless rate is low by historical standards, economists said.
But its steady increase in the past year triggered the so-called ""Sahm rule."" If history is a guide, that would suggest the U.S. economy is already in a recession.
The Sahm rule is triggered when the three-month moving average of the U.S. unemployment rate is half a percentage point (or more) above its low over the prior 12 months.
That threshold was breached in July, when the Sahm rule recession indicator hit 0.53 points.
Goldman Sachs raised its recession forecast over the weekend to 25% from 15%. (Downturns occur every six to seven years, on average, putting the annual odds around 15%, economists said.)
Zandi estimates the chances of a recession starting over the next year at about 1 in 3, roughly double the historical norm. Bryson puts the probability at about 30% to 40%.
The Sahm rule may not be accurate this time
However, there's good reason to think the Sahm rule isn't an accurate recession indicator in the current economic cycle, Zandi said.
This is due to how the unemployment rate is calculated: The unemployment rate is a share of unemployed people as a percent of the labor force. So, changes in two variables — the number of unemployed and the size of the labor force — can move it up or down.
More from Personal Finance:
'Don't panic' amid stock market volatility
This labor data trend is a 'warning sign,' economist says
Now is the time to buy stocks 'on sale'
The Sahm rule has historically been triggered by a weakening demand for workers. Businesses laid off employees, and the ranks of unemployed people swelled.
However, the unemployment rate's rise over the past year is largely for ""good reasons"" — specifically, a big increase in labor supply, Bryson said.
More Americans entered the job market and looked for work. Those who are on the sidelines and looking for work are officially counted amid the ranks of ""unemployed"" in federal data, thereby boosting the unemployment rate.
The labor force grew by 420,000 people in July relative to June — a ""pretty big"" number, Bryson said.
Meanwhile, some federal data suggest businesses are holding on to workers: The layoff rate was 0.9% in June, tied for the lowest on record dating to 2000, for example.
'The flags are turning red'
That said, there have been worrying signs of broader cooling in the labor market, economists said.
For example, hiring has slowed below its pre-pandemic baseline, as have the share of workers quitting for new gigs. Claims for unemployment benefits have gradually increased. The unemployment rate is at its highest level since the fall of 2021.
""The labor market is in a perilous spot,"" Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at job site Indeed, wrote in a memo Friday.
""Yellow flags had started to pop up in the labor market data over the past few months, but now the flags are turning red,"" he added.
Other positive signs
There are some positive indicators that counter the negatives and suggest the economy remains resilient, however.
For example, ""real"" consumer spending (i.e., spending after accounting for inflation) remains strong ""across the board,"" Zandi said.
That's important since consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. If consumers keep spending, the economy will ""be just fine,"" Zandi said.
I think far and away the most likely scenario is a soft landing: The economy avoids an economic downturn.Mark Zandichief economist at Moody's
Underlying fundamentals in the economy like the financial health of households are ""still pretty good"" in aggregate, Bryson said.
It's also a near certainty the Fed will start cutting interest rates in September, taking some pressure off households, especially lower earners, economists said.
""This is not September 2008, by any stretch of the imagination, where it was 'jump into a fox hole as fast as you can,'"" Bryson said. ""Nor is it March 2020 when the economy was shutting down.""
""But there are some signs the economy is starting to weaken here,"" he added."

"LTCG amendment: Experts cheer decision to restore indexation benefit for property. Why this govt move matters
Land and building owners now have a reason to cheer. The government has proposed an amendment to the Finance Bill 2024 regarding long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, thereby relieving property owners of the extra tax burden that would have arisen on account of the latest changes announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23 in the Union Budget 2024.
In the list of amendments to the Finance Bill (No. 2) 2024, the government has proposed that indexation benefit will be restored for immovable property bought before July 23, 2024. As per the provisions, tax would be calculated at the rate of 12.5 per cent without indexation, but if it exceeds 20 per cent with indexation, it would be ignored.
This has been proposed only for resident individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs).
The Budget 2024 announced that land and properties sold after July 23, 2024, would draw a long-term capital gains tax of 12.5 per cent without indexation instead of 20 per cent with indexation that existed earlier. The provision took effect immediately, i.e., July 23, 2024.
This change was condemned by a number of taxpayers and observers including Dr Saumya Aggarwal, an assistant professor at Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) who shared her critical viewpoint in this interview.
The amendment says that if the new tax rate, i.e., 12.5 per cent (minus indexation) leads to a higher tax liability than 20 per cent with indexation, then the extra tax will be ignored. The relief is offered only in cases where the property was bought before July 23, 2024.
The amendment has received a thumbs-up from the stakeholders across the board. And rightly so.
Experts unanimously call the amendment a positive move since it will ensure that the indexation benefits will apply when the taxpayer is set to suffer loss because of new legislation. Although the relief is offered only on properties purchased before July 23, it is seen as a positive step by the government.
“This amendment aims to benefit property owners by offering more flexibility in tax calculations, potentially reducing tax liability based on individual circumstances. Importantly, indexation benefits will not apply if a taxpayer incurs a loss. Additionally, if a taxpayer has a profit without indexation but a loss with indexation, their tax payable will be zero. However, taxpayers cannot claim a loss resulting from the indexation benefit. The changes do not fully restore indexation benefits, as immovable properties acquired on or after July 23, 2024, will not be eligible for indexation. This amendment is a positive step from the finance minister, addressing concerns about the removal of indexation benefits while maintaining tax parity across asset classes,” said Mitesh Jain, Partner, Economic Laws Practice.
Ravi Bishnoi, Partner at Saraf & Partners, said, “This is a welcome move by the government as the investors would have the option to choose the calculation method which is favourable as far as tax outgo is concerned. This is mainly beneficial for owners who have held a property for a long period and the value of the property has appreciated significantly.”

“This amendment will be a relief for taxpayers who were paying excess tax due to flat rate of 12.5 per cent with no indexation benefit,” said CA Pratibha Goyal, a Delhi-based chartered accountant.
Meanwhile, in another development, Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) reiterated its request to the government to extend grandfathering of indexation benefit to debt mutual funds till July 2024 so that investors are not taxed retrospectively.

I’m an Economist: Here’s What a Harris Win Would Mean for the Tax Burden on the Rich
It was always good to be rich, but there has never been a better time to have money to burn than right now.
According to the Institute for Policy Studies, America’s billionaires got 62% richer during the COVID crisis, with the nonprofit Oxfam reporting that the world’s 1% gobbled up two-thirds of the $42 trillion in new wealth created in the ensuing post-pandemic years.

Read Next: 7 Reasons You Should Consider a Financial Advisor To Boost Your Savings
Like her current boss, President Joe Biden — the man whose office she hopes to become the first woman to occupy — Vice President Kamala Harris believes those kinds of statistics reveal a toxic level of wealth disparity and economic inequity. If she wins in November and has the support of a friendly Congress, the ultra-rich and even the regular-rich should expect Harris to put their vast fortunes squarely in her crosshairs.
Earning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.
Meet the Expert
Dennis Shirshikov is a professor of finance, accounting and economics at City University of New York. Not only does he hold a stellar 4.9-out-of-five rating from RateMyProfessor, but he has firsthand experience building and maintaining wealth through changes in parties, administrations and policies. A longtime real estate investor, he serves as the head of growth at the vacation property investment platform GoSummer. He’s a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal, Time and Forbes, and covers the intersection of governmental policy and wealth accumulation in the academic courses he teaches.
In his estimation, the greatest impact a Harris victory would have on the rich likely would come through adjustments to the IRS tax code.
“A Kamala Harris presidency could bring significant changes to the tax landscape for the wealthy,” he said.

Harris Backs a Targeted ‘Wealth Tax’ on the Richest of the Rich
Presuming a friendly Congress, Harris has signaled that as president, she would adopt President Biden’s long-standing position that the richest Americans don’t pay their fair share in taxes.
“A Kamala Harris presidency is likely to pursue tax policies aimed at increasing the tax burden on the wealthy,” Shirshikov said. “Harris has previously endorsed policies to increase the tax burden on high-income earners, such as raising the top marginal tax rate and implementing a wealth tax.”
The wealth tax Shirshikov references comes from the official Biden-Harris 2025 budget proposal, which reads, “The tax code currently offers special treatment for the types of income that wealthy people enjoy. While the wages and salaries that everyday Americans earn are taxed as ordinary income, billionaires make their money in ways that are taxed at lower rates, and sometimes not taxed at all. This special treatment, combined with sophisticated tax planning and giant loopholes, allows many of the wealthiest Americans to pay lower rates on their full income than many middle-class households pay. To finally address this glaring inequity, the budget includes a 25% minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01%, those with wealth of more than $100 million.”
Capital Gains — Even Unrealized Gains — Could Be Taxed as Regular Income
Shirshikov cited the vice president’s commitment to “closing loopholes that disproportionately benefit high earners,” echoing the language of the White House budget proposal itself.
Since the rich typically rely more on investment income than salary, the budget would tax capital gains at the same rate as regular income for individuals earning $1 million or more and eliminate the so-called carried interest loophole, which the White House budget proposal says “allows some wealthy investment fund managers to pay tax at lower rates than their secretaries,” and close the “‘like-kind exchange loophole’ that lets real estate investors defer tax indefinitely.”
However, the most striking proposal is what IFC Media, the leading publishing house for the global wealth management industry, calls a “radical departure from normal taxation” — the taxing of unrealized gains for the ultra-rich.
An old investing adage is you don’t lose anything until you sell. Conversely, since unharvested returns are still unrealized gains, they’re not subject to taxation — at least not yet.
Her proposed 25% tax on unrealized gains for centi-millionaires with nine-figure fortunes or more would be a watershed moment for U.S. tax policy.
Even Garden Variety Rich People Should Expect a Higher Income Tax Rate
Harris’s pursuit of a wealth tax on the ultra-rich is a relatively easy sell in a country where millions live paycheck to paycheck.
“This approach aligns with her broader goal of addressing income inequality and ensuring that the wealthiest Americans contribute a fairer share to public revenues,” Shirshikov said.
However, he also expects an increase to the highest marginal tax rate. That’s a much wider net that would ensnare not just a handful of ultra-wealthy centi-millionaires and billionaires, but vast swaths of comparatively ordinary high earners, many of whom might not even consider themselves rich.
The Biden-Harris 2025 budget proposal would repeal the provision of Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that lowered tax rates for high earners to 37%, “restoring the top tax rate of 39.6% for single filers making more than $400,000 a year and married couples making more than $450,000 per year,” according to the administration’s official budget proposal.
Compared to billionaires, a person earning $400,000 might seem like small potatoes. However, according to the Tax Foundation, that income level puts you in the top 2% — and the Biden-Harris administration thinks the 98th percentile is a reasonable floor for targeted taxes on the rich, so America’s aristocracy would be wise to start huddling with their financial advisors now in preparation.
Shirshikov said, “These measures are intended to address income inequality and generate revenue for social programs, potentially impacting investment strategies and financial planning for the affluent.”

"Mines ministry working on rolling out Critical Mineral Mission this year: Official
The mines ministry is working on rolling out the Critical Mineral Mission this year, Mines Secretary V L Kantha Rao said on Wednesday. Union Budget 2024-25 has proposed launching Critical Mineral Mission for domestic production, recycling of critical minerals, and overseas acquisition of critical mineral assets.
Its mandate will include technology development, skilled workforce, extended producer responsibility framework, and a suitable financing mechanism.
""It was announced that the government will set up Critical Mineral Mission for focused activities relating to critical minerals whether it is exploration, mining, research and development, foreign acquisition or any financial support or recycling.
""All these aspects would be covered in this Critical Mineral Mission and Ministry of Mines is working on this announcement and we will look forward to the mission being approved at the government level and the mission being rolled out this year,"" Rao said at the felicitation ceremony of five-star rated mines.
Critical minerals, such as cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel and rare earths, play a crucial role in the production of clean energy technologies, from wind turbines to electric cars.
Such minerals are particularly in demand for production of batteries for electric cars. The government, he said, has successfully auctioned 14 critical mineral mines.
""So the mining practises in the critical mineral mines will have to be studied because this is the first time that these kinds of mines will become operational in the country. We will have to study how these mines are operationalised in other countries and what are the specific practises relating to critical mineral mines and we may have to incorporate some of those into the star rating system,"" he explained.
During the Union Budget, it was announced that the government will do the first auction of offshore mineral blocks this year, he said and added that ""we are working on that as well.""
Minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are critical for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence, telecommunications, and high-tech electronics.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her budget speech proposed to fully exempt customs duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce BCD (basic customs duty) on two of them.
This will provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and help secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors.
Its mandate will include technology development, skilled workforce, extended producer responsibility framework, and a suitable financing mechanism.
""It was announced that the government will set up Critical Mineral Mission for focused activities relating to critical minerals whether it is exploration, mining, research and development, foreign acquisition or any financial support or recycling.
""All these aspects would be covered in this Critical Mineral Mission and Ministry of Mines is working on this announcement and we will look forward to the mission being approved at the government level and the mission being rolled out this year,"" Rao said at the felicitation ceremony of five-star rated mines.
Critical minerals, such as cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel and rare earths, play a crucial role in the production of clean energy technologies, from wind turbines to electric cars.
Such minerals are particularly in demand for production of batteries for electric cars. The government, he said, has successfully auctioned 14 critical mineral mines.
""So the mining practises in the critical mineral mines will have to be studied because this is the first time that these kinds of mines will become operational in the country. We will have to study how these mines are operationalised in other countries and what are the specific practises relating to critical mineral mines and we may have to incorporate some of those into the star rating system,"" he explained.

"US and EU express concern about Move Forward demise
The United States and the European Union on Wednesday issued statements expressing serious concern about the Constitutional Court order dissolving the opposition Move Forward Party and its implications for democracy in Thailand.
The US State Department said the decision “jeopardises Thailand’s democratic progress and runs counter to the aspirations of the Thai people for a strong, democratic future”.
“The United States does not take a position in support of any political party, but as a close ally and friend with deep and enduring ties, we urge Thailand to take actions to ensure fully inclusive political participation, and to protect democracy and the freedoms of association and expression,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.
“This decision disenfranchises the more than 14 million Thais who voted for the Move Forward Party in the May 2023 election and raises questions about their representation within Thailand’s electoral system.
“Inclusive political participation strengthens social cohesion and is a critical component of resilient national institutions,” he added.
The European Union called the court ruling “a setback for political pluralism in Thailand”, noting that Move Forward placed first in the 2023 general election with 14 million votes out of 39 million.
“No democratic system can function without a plurality of parties and candidates,” said a statement issued by the European External Action Service press team.
“Any limitation on the exercise of free association and expression, in particular through the activities and formation of political parties, must be consistent with relevant provisions and principles of international instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.""
The statement added that the EU “stands ready to broaden its engagement with Thailand” under a cooperation deal signed in 2022 that covers issues including “democratic pluralism, fundamental freedoms and human rights”.
Amnesty International issued a statement describing the court decision as “untenable” and said it showed that laws in Thailand were being used to intimidate critics. The Asian Forum for Human Rights said it posed “serious risks to democratic principles”.
PM Srettha hopeful
Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin expressed confidence on Wednesday that Move Forward would find a way to overcome the political turbulence. He dismissed speculation that its dissolution would weaken the opposition camp.
Political economist Somjai Phagaphasvivat said the party’s dissolution is unlikely to have any adverse impacts because it is not the government and investors might have foreseen this.
He said that protests might be held, but they are unlikely to be prolonged or become uncontrolled or turn violent.
Varakorn Samakoses, an economics and finance commentator, said the case might have medium- and long- term impacts because a party dissolution might make some investors feel uncertain about the country’s policies.
He noted, however, that the ethics case against Mr Srettha, on which the court will rule next week, will have more impact if the ruling is unfavourable to the premier.
Move Forward is the third party to be disbanded under the current constitution, after Thai Raksa Chart prior to the 2019 election and the Future Forward Party in 2020.

"17 Thriving One-Person Business Ideas to Try
17 Thriving One-Person Business Ideas to Try
When you buy something through one of the links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.
Want to start a business you can run entirely by yourself? Then you'll love these one-person business ideas.
In this post, I'll cover the benefits of these businesses and how you can get started with each one.
I've also categorized them into four groups:
- Digital content based
- Service based
- eCommerce based
- Advisory based
This will help you find the right business type for you as a solopreneur.
Let's dive in.
Contents
Digital Content Based One-Person Business Ideas
This category of one-person business ideas involves publishing content online. You then have a multitude of ways to monetize the traffic, which I dive into below.
1. Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is my top pick for one-person business ideas because it can be run entirely by you alone and has the potential for significant passive income.
You don't need to store or distribute inventory, deal with customer support, or even need your own product.
That's because you sign up for an affiliate program and promote other people's products. When your audience buys from your unique link, you get paid a commission.
Here's what you'll need:
- A platform to publish content
- Compelling content (that sells)
- Traffic
That's it!
Now, choosing the platform is easy enough. This depends on the type of content you want to make.
- YouTube for videos
- Social media for short posts
- Blogging for in-depth guides
- Newsletters for personal connection/stories
I cover many of these platforms later in this post.
The tricky bit?
Creating content that sells and getting traffic. But with some help from Matt Diggity, this business model is a breeze.
He has an entire course on affiliate marketing and plenty of free videos to get you started.
You can learn more from Matt Diggity's course here and get started with affiliate marketing today.
2. YouTube Channel
More than 1 billion hours of video are watched daily on YouTube. That's why starting a YouTube channel is another great one-person business idea.
A few other reasons:
- You can start today with just your camera phone
- Zero startup costs
- Multiple monetization methods
- No need to hire staff
Let's break down a simple strategy to get you started.
- Find a YouTube niche
- Start YouTube affiliate marketing
- Add valuable content to grow your channel
- Once you reach the monetization threshold, turn on ads
That's it! You can make passive income with affiliate marketing right away, then turn on ads once you've got enough subscribers (and watch hours).
You can add more monetization methods, such as online courses later. More on this one-person business idea next.
To get the most success from YouTube, check out our post on how to increase YouTube subscribers.
3. Sell Online Courses
Do you like the idea of teaching something you know? Then, selling an online course might be for you.
Here's the deal.
Even though the internet has made it possible to learn literally anything for free, the eLearning industry is at an all-time high. Plus, it's expected to reach a market value of $1 trillion by 2032.
That's because people have a ton of fear and doubt when learning something new. By packaging up your knowledge in video format, you can guide people to mastering your craft.
Whether it's cooking, coding, or crafting, there's room for you to get a piece of the pie. You can host it on an online course platform and use YouTube to get traffic.
You can read this guide on how to build an online course that sells to help you get started.
4. Newsletter
A newsletter side hustle might be the perfect business if you want to work alone.
It works by building an audience through email marketing and sharing your words of wisdom.
You can then monetize your list through promoting affiliate offers, selling a service, or whatever you like.
The huge benefit is that you own the audience and aren't governed by an algorithm that can take away your reach overnight.
You simply send regular emails with tons of value, then recommend products you know your list will love.
5. Self-Publishing
If you liked the selling online courses business idea, but don't want to record videos, then you'll love self-publishing.
This is where you package up your knowledge in a book. You can take advantage of the 487 million eBooks sold on Amazon every year.
All you have to do is choose topics people want to learn about and start writing. Then, you upload to Amazon KDP and watch the sales come in.
Want to learn more? Read our post on how to publish a book on Amazon and make money.
6. Blogging
Blogging has been one of the most appealing business models for solopreneurs for years.
That's because you can utilize so many blog monetization strategies and only focus on content creation.
If you want to save yourself a ton of time, I highly recommend The Authority Site System by Authority Hacker.
In this course, you'll learn everything you need to know about building a successful business in blogging.
Plus, you can get 40% off the course here.
Service-Based One-Person Business Ideas
A service business is great if you need to make money fast. You can start most of these one-person business ideas by applying on job boards or freelance platforms like Upwork.
7. Freelance Writing
I've been a freelance writer for close to three years and found great success.
- I work from home (or a coffee shop)
- Choose my own hours
- And help businesses make more money
The best bit is it's easy to learn, and there are plenty of businesses that need content marketing.
Plus you can write for blogs, social media, email marketing, and more, so there are plenty of options to choose from.
To get started, you can take a content writing course and find work on ProBlogger.
8. Graphic Designer
Starting a graphic design business couldn't be easier right now. There are so many tools and resources that make it a great business model.
Just look at Brett from Design Joy. He has productized his graphic design service into a $5,000-per-month subscription.
He now makes $120,000 per month!
So, if you know how to use tools like Figma, there are plenty of ways to turn it into a successful online business.
One way is to create an offer on Fiverr. Another option is to find clients by posting tutorials on YouTube.
9. Video Editor
Just like the previous one-person business idea, a video editor is another one that can work well.
If you're completely new, you'll first want to learn the fundamentals. You can do this by searching for ""video editing course"" on YouTube or looking for the best Udemy courses.
Then, you'll need experience editing video for businesses or YouTube channels. Once you've gained the confidence, you can increase your prices, work freelance, or create a productized service like Design Joy.
10. Web Developer
Do you love writing code, turning designs into web templates, or using page builders like Elementor?
Then web development might be the best one-person business idea for you. Again, there is no shortage of businesses that need web developers, and it's not as hard to learn as you might think.
Here's a simple marketing strategy to follow:
- Choose a niche: WordPress developer for coaches or Webflow developer for SaaS companies
- Create a portfolio: Create your own templates or examples website
- Set your pricing: Charge anything from $1,499 to $10,000 per project depending on what's included
- Find clients: Use YouTube by creating tutorials or send a free website audit to the business owner
11. Social Media Marketer
If you enjoy posting on social media and are good at getting people to engage, then social media marketing is for you.
That's right, you can make a business out of it. Whether you manage a business's social media platform or help them run ads, companies are willing to pay good money for it.
The best way to get started is to choose a small business you want to work with, such as Facebook ads for plumbers or Instagram ads for eCommerce fitness brands.
Next, learn the basics from Udemy courses or YouTube videos. Then start reaching out to brands on social media offering to help.
In the beginning, you can charge a small fee for your time or for free in exchange for testimonials.
Once you've built up a good reputation, you can start charging between $500 and $2,000 per month, depending on your business goals.
eCommerce Based One-Person Business Ideas
The next group of one-person business ideas involves selling physical products. Thanks to today's technology, eCommerce stores can often be run by a single person.
12. Print on Demand
Print-on-demand, or POD, is where you sell designs that get printed on physical products like shirts or mugs.
The great thing about this model is that you don't need to do the printing. You can either buy ready-made designs from Creative Market or make your own designs in Canva.
Then you create mock-ups of your products so people can see what they will look like. In other words, you add your design to an image of the t-shirts and other products you sell.
Here's a tutorial:
Lastly, you drive traffic to your store using Facebook ads. When people buy, the design is sent to the print-on-demand company, which prints the design and sends it to the customer.
13. Sell Handmade Items
If you're a skilled crafter or DIY enthusiast, then selling unique handmade items might be your jam.
This could be a great way to turn a hobby into a thriving business, and a platform like Etsy is a perfect place to get started.
That's because Etsy generated $2.748 billion in sales in 2023 and gets around 500 million visitors every month.
Simply set up your store, upload high-quality photos of your products, and optimize your product listings.
You'll be able to do what you love and find customers who appreciate your craftsmanship.
You can also read our post on how to make money on Etsy for more details.
14. Fulfilled by Amazon
Fulfilled by Amazon or FBA gives you access to Amazon's huge customer base and distribution network without the hassle of shipping and customer service.
All you have to do as an aspiring entrepreneur is send your products to Amazon's fulfillment centers, and they handle the rest. You can focus on sourcing products and scaling your business.
First, you'll need to choose the right products to sell. You can do this with Amazon FBA software or by looking through the bestsellers.
Second, find a manufacturer on Alibaba and order a sample. Once you're happy with the product, you can order your first batch.
Lastly, work on getting more reviews on Amazon so that your listing gets more views.
Then, replenish your stock when you're getting low.
Advisory Based One-Person Business Ideas
This last category of business ideas for solopreneurs is where you are paid for your expertise and advice. Let's take a look.
15. Business Consultant
A business consultant is someone who is an expert in the field of business. So this business idea is perfect for you if you've had business success.
You'll typically help businesses grow and improve efficiency. This can be through strategy, operations, management, or helping them clarify their vision.
Many business consultants will specialize in a specific niche that reflects their strengths and experience, which can help establish expertise.
If you want to get into this one-person business, be sure to read how to start a consulting business.
16. Life or Fitness Coach
Like the vehicle, a coach helps a person get from where they currently are to where they want to be.
And coaching as a business has blown up in recent years. Some people say that coaching is too saturated, but that's not true.
To be a successful coach, you need to differentiate yourself and find a unique selling proposition or USP.
Plus, it would be wise to learn how to coach people.
Essentially, coaching involves listening to the client's problems from their current perspective. Then, asking them questions to help shift that perspective.
Coaching is not about giving advice because the most effective level of change is done on the subconscious level. Therefore, the client must question their own way of thinking that is keeping them stuck instead of being told.
So, if you're a good listener and can formulate transformative questions, coaching as a one-person business will be perfect for you.
17. Financial Planner
This last idea for solo businesses requires a formal qualification. However, that didn't stop Kyle Nolan from breaking into the finance space with his financial planning tool.
Plus there are countless bloggers who find success in the FIRE niche, who aren't ""qualified"" financial advisors. That stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early.
These people have figured out how to become financially free and retire at a young age.
The point is this: If you are successful with money, whether it's spending money wisely or making a lot of it, you probably have enough wisdom to share with the world.
You could do a number of the things on this list as a business in the finance space, such as a YouTube channel, newsletter, and a blog.
Conclusion
Now it's over to you. Which of these one-person business ideas will you choose?
If you want a completely solo business where you don't even need to interact with customers, then affiliate marketing is the best option.
You can learn how to start an affiliate marketing business in Matt Diggity's course, The Affiliate Lab.
Whichever one you choose, simplicity and taking consistent action every day is key. Good luck!

"Bill Gates befriended Jeffrey Epstein for this favor from sex predator: report
Microsoft mogul Bill Gates was drawn to late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein largely because he thought he could help him secure a Nobel Peace Prize, according to a new book.
Author Anupreeta Das, finance editor at the New York Times, wrote in ""Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King: Bill Gates and His Quest to Shape Our World,"" that the tech titan had become fixated on landing the award – and thought Epstein could help him do so.
The notorious predator pleaded guilty to procuring underaged girls in 2008, and began to pursue a relationship with Gates in 2010 to help sanitize his own marred image at the time, according to a New York Post report on Das' book.
Epstein relayed to a Gates Foundation staffer that he could help the computer pioneer connect with Nobel influencers.
Several years later, the pair – along with Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod-Larsen – flew to France to meet with Thorbjorn Jagland, chair of the Nobel committee, Das wrote.
But the 2013 sit-down never got Gates over the line, and Rod-Larsen was later forced to resign from the International Peace Institute in 2020 due to his ties to Epstein.
Gates called the time he spent with Epstein a ""huge mistake"" in an interview with CNN in 2021.
A Gates spokesperson blasted portions of the book in a statement to The Post.
""The book includes highly sensationalized allegations and outright falsehoods that ignore the actual documented facts our office provided to the author on numerous occasions,"" the publicist said.
BILL AND MELINDA GATES ARE OFFICIALLY DIVORCED
A representative for Gates, 68, told media outlets that he regretted his associations with Epstein, and that their links were limited to philanthropy rather than philandering.
Gates' ex-wife, Melinda Gates, has said she was wary of his interactions with the infamous womanizer and met him personally on one occasion.

"Dogecoin Struggles To Compete With New 1000x Rival
Dogecoin (DOGE), once the undisputed king of meme coins, is now facing fierce competition from a rising star: Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a staple in the cryptocurrency market for years, recent developments indicate that Mpeppe might be the new contender capable of outshining the legendary Dogecoin (DOGE) with its potential 1000x gains. Let’s dive into the recent performance and prospects of these two cryptocurrencies.
Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Kid on the Block
Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, priced at 0.00107 USDT per token. The presale has already raised $589,695, with 75.26% of the total tokens sold. This rapid uptake reflects growing investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential. With only 235,023,783 tokens remaining, the buzz around Mpeppe is palpable.
Mpeppe’s success in the presale phase is a testament to its promising future. Investors are eager to get in early, anticipating massive returns as the token prepares to transition to the next stage at a higher price of 0.001777 USDT. The strong presale performance indicates that Mpeppe is well on its way to making significant waves in the crypto market.
Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Current Struggles
Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a challenging period. The live price of Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.098749 per DOGE/USD, with a market cap of $14.36 billion USD. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin has seen a decline of 0.82% in the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $996.73 million USD. This performance has resulted in Dogecoin slipping to the 10th position among the largest cryptocurrencies.
Dogecoin’s decline is attributed to several factors, including a significant whale movement of 117.52 million DOGE worth $11 million USD to Robinhood, an American exchange. This movement sparked panic in the market, indicating a potential sell-off. Additionally, Dogecoin faced massive liquidations, with $14.74 million USD liquidated in the last 24 hours, highlighting the extreme volatility and market pressure Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently under.
Market Reactions and Predictions
The recent downturn has seen Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price fall below $0.08, a stark contrast to its peak of $0.14 just two weeks ago. Technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are showing bearish momentum. The MACD is in the negative zone, and the RSI indicates that Dogecoin (DOGE) is oversold. These metrics suggest that unless there is significant buying pressure, Dogecoin may continue to struggle in the near term.
In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum. With strong community support and a successful presale, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a serious contender in the crypto space. The token’s innovative approach and high return potential are attracting investors looking for the next big opportunity.
The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE)
The optimism surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by its unique value proposition. Unlike many meme coins, Mpeppe offers real utility through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. This blend of fun and functionality is attracting a diverse range of investors seeking substantial returns.
Crypto analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s potential, predicting that it could achieve up to 1000x returns. This forecast is based on Mpeppe’s innovative approach, strong community support, and the significant interest it has garnered during its presale phase. Early investors are particularly optimistic about the substantial gains they could achieve as Mpeppe continues to gain traction.
For those interested in investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. Ensuring the correct contract address is crucial to avoid scams and secure your investment.
Conclusion
While Dogecoin (DOGE) grapples with its current market challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable rival with the potential to deliver massive returns. Dogecoin’s recent struggles highlight the volatility and risks inherent in the crypto market. In contrast, Mpeppe’s strong presale performance and promising future make it an attractive option for investors seeking high returns. As the crypto landscape evolves, Mpeppe is set to become a key player, possibly overshadowing the once-dominant Dogecoin.
Investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on new opportunities should consider Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a viable option. With its unique value proposition and high return potential, Mpeppe could be the next big thing in the crypto world.

"Flourish Ventures on repeat founders, emerging markets, and when not to hop on the AI bandwagon
In today’s episode of Equity Podcast, Mary Ann Azevedo talked to Flourish Ventures co-founders Tilman Ehrbeck, Emmalyn Shaw and Arjuna Costa about a variety of topics, including how their investment themes have evolved in the past five years and what trends they’re most excited about. We also got their opinion on M&A deals in fintech, AI and founder wellness, among other things.
The trio founded Flourish Ventures in 2019 and now the firm has $850 million under management, last raising a $350 million fund in October 2023. Flourish invests all over the world, backing fintech startups in the U.S., and across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Notable investments include digital bank Chime, Brazilian neobank Neon, which was last priced at $1.6 billion, embedded finance startup Unit and African payments infrastructure company Flutterwave.
As investors in emerging markets, the firm has noticed an interesting phenomenon: repeat founders.
“One thing we’re seeing that’s really heartening is we’re backing entrepreneurs for the second time within our own portfolio,” Costa said. “That maturity of founders and the level of thought diligence they bring to the second time around journey is really impressive to see. We’ve expected that in Silicon Valley and New York for a long time but to start to see that happen in markets like Indonesia, India, Brazil and Mexico is, is very heartening.”
One thing the team is not doing is jumping on the AI bandwagon. They are approaching the space thoughtfully.
“I would be surprised if we would bet and pick and seek a company that’s specifically AI fintech on its own accord as a standalone opportunity,” Shaw said. “It would have to be something they’d embed in as a core part of their offering to help streamline certain processes.”
She added: “In fact, the more it’s relying on AI, the more you’d have to ask yourself, what is your defensibility then?”
On the M&A front, Shaw acknowledged that activity has been picking up.
“The expectation is that as this activity continues, we’re going to start to see a lot more M&A activity in conjunction with what we hope to be IPO window opening for fintech as well,” she said.

"Shiba Inu Whales Secure Their 1000x Profits From New ICO Rival
Shiba Inu (SHIB) has captured the imagination of the crypto community with its unique branding and dedicated following. However, recent events have highlighted some challenges for SHIB investors. Despite an extraordinary increase in the token burn rate, with over 81 million SHIB tokens burned, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a decline. This burn event, while initially sparking optimism, also raised concerns about the token’s long-term value and stability.
SHIB Burn Rate Surge: Implications for Investors
Recently, the burn rate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged by 4000%, leading to the destruction of 81 million tokens. This dramatic increase in token burning was intended to reduce supply and potentially increase the token’s value. However, despite this significant burn, SHIB’s price has fallen to $0.00001579, marking a 4% decline over the past week. The burn event has created a mix of optimism and uncertainty among investors, with some questioning whether SHIB can ever reach the $1 mark.
Market Reactions to SHIB Burn
The market reaction to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) aggressive burn strategy has been mixed. While some investors see the burn as a positive step towards increasing scarcity and value, others are concerned about its immediate impact on price and market dynamics. The dramatic increase in the burn rate has altered investor sentiment and led to a re-evaluation of SHIB’s market position relative to other meme coins.
Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New ICO Rival
As Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces these challenges, a new contender has emerged: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at 0.00107 USDT per token, with over 75% of the tokens already sold, raising an impressive $589,695. This rapid uptake reflects strong investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential to deliver substantial returns.
The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE)
Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it offers tangible utility through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. This unique blend of entertainment and practical use makes Mpeppe an attractive option for investors seeking both enjoyment and profit. The token’s innovative approach and strong community support have positioned it as a promising alternative to Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Whales’ Influence on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Whales, or large holders of Shiba Inu (SHIB), have had a significant impact on the token’s market dynamics. Recently, a whale moved a substantial amount of DOGE, worth approximately $11 million, to Robinhood, causing panic among investors. This movement highlighted the volatility and the influence that large holders can have on the market. The substantial sell-off contributed to a 24% decline in SHIB’s price, pushing it down to the tenth position among the largest cryptocurrencies.
Shifting Focus: From SHIB to MPEPE
As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to grapple with market volatility, whales and other large investors are beginning to shift their focus to Mpeppe (MPEPE). The new ICO rival offers promising returns and practical utility, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their investments and secure high profits. Mpeppe’s potential for 1000x returns, driven by its innovative approach and strong community engagement, is drawing significant interest from investors.
The Future of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE)
The future of Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains uncertain, with the token needing to navigate significant market challenges to regain its former glory. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised for substantial growth, with its current presale success and practical applications setting the stage for a promising future. Investors looking for high returns and innovative solutions should consider adding Mpeppe to their portfolios.
Conclusion: Diversifying with Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)
In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, diversification is key to managing risk and maximizing returns. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers a well-established market presence, Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings innovation and practical utility to the table. Together, they represent a balanced approach to investing in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.
For those interested in exploring Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. As always, conducting thorough research and considering the risks is essential before making any investment decisions.

"The best steam mops of 2024
If you’re new to the steam cleaner world, experts often consider steam mops, which are easy to use and take care of, the best place to start. While a regular mop uses water to remove dirt and grime wooden floors, tile and laminate, a steam mop, emits hot vaporized water to take things further and give you a deeper clean.
To find the best steam mops on the market, I spoke with cleaning experts about what to look for in a mop and which ones are the most effective to use for cleaning different floor types.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best steam mops | The best steam mops of 2024 | How to shop for a steam mop
How I picked the best steam mops
When building this list I consulted experts about what to look for in a steam mop. Here’s what they recommend I keep in mind:
- Heat level and retention: Steam mops need to heat water quickly and maintain that heat, according to Rueven Noyman, the owner of On Time Steam Cleaning in New York City. This way, it can continuously clean at the same level and/or thoroughness. Noyman recommends machines that can reach 200 degrees or higher for tough messes.
- Water tank capacity: How much water your steam mop can hold also plays a role in how efficiently you can use it. If your steam mop only holds a small amount of water you won’t get far cleaning a large surface area before it runs out, according to Will Cotter, the owner of a cleaning services company. “You don’t want to have to keep refilling it every five minutes, so make sure you find a model that can hold enough water to clean for as long as you need,” he says. Typically, the larger the appliance, the more water the tank can hold.
- Versatility: Models will have different features and functions that you can explore. Look for mops that have detachable handheld attachments so that you can use them to clean upholstered surfaces, like couches and curtains, or elevated areas such as window sills and crown molding.
- Run time: Similar to vacuums, steam mops are available in both corded and cordless options, each of which have benefits and drawbacks. Since the power sources are different, it can affect how thorough the mop is, according to Cotter. Cordless options are great if you plan to move around large spaces, but they tend to have a difference in power and steam pressure since they rely on battery power, according to Cotter.
The best steam mops of 2024
All of the recommendations below are either direct recommendations from our experts or highly rated options with at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more on Amazon. I mostly focused on corded options since they have more varied price points and are more reliable and consistent than cordless ones.
PurSteam 10-in-1 Steam Mop
- Converts into a handheld model
- Has grout attachments
- Can use it on clothes
- Nothing to note at this time
You can use this steam mop, which has a 4.2-star average rating from 51,489 reviews on Amazon, for cleaning smudged hardwood floors or stains on carpets. (When steam cleaning a carpet, be sure to use the carpet glider attachment and increase air circulation in the room by running a fan or opening windows to speed up the drying process and prevent mold from forming). The middle compartment detaches and works as a handheld steam cleaner, which makes it easy to use on elevated surfaces such as crown molding and upholstered furniture. You can also use it to clean glass surfaces like mirrors and glass sliding doors and even to remove wrinkles from certain clothes. It comes with a window squeegee, a straight nozzle and a set of nylon brushes which are great for cleaning grout on floors or walls. At 4.4 pounds, this is the lightest option on our list.
Type: corded | Cord length: n/a | Water tank capacity: 12.8 fl. oz. | Handheld option: yes | Weight: 4.4 lbs. | Safe on: hardwood, tile, laminate and carpet | Max temperature: up to 212 degrees
Bissell PowerFresh All-in-One Vacuum and Steam Mop

You can also easily remove the reusable mop pad by flipping a switch on the pad tray at the bottom with your foot. Then, throw it in the wash with the rest of your clothes and bedding. It has a 4.2-star average rating from 10,041 reviews on Amazon.
Type: corded | Cord length: n/a | Water tank capacity: 12.8 fl. oz. | Handheld option: no | Weight: 13.61 lbs. | Safe on: hardwood, tile, linoleum, ceramic and marble | Max temperature: 194 degrees
Bissell CrossWave Hydro Steam Wet-Dry Vacuum
- Two water tanks
- Long cord
- Heavy
Cotter previously recommended this appliance in our guide to the best steam cleaners for cleaning pet-related messes. Think of it as a vacuum and steam mop in one: It can pick up solid debris like food crumbs, pet hair and dirt, mop up spilled drinks and steam clean hardwood and tile. It also comes with three scented cleaning solutions for different floor and mess types, including one for pets. Plus, it has two water tanks: one for clean water and another for dirty water, that way you don’t have to worry about accidentally pushing messes around your floors.

Steam and Go 10-in-1 Steam Mop
- High maximum temperature
- Can use as a handheld option
- Steams clothes
- Corded
This steam mop comes with multiple attachments, including small brushes and upholstery pads for cleaning grout, furniture and curtains. The triangular mop head makes it easy to clean up corners and edges, and the middle compartment detaches and so you can use it as a handheld steam cleaner. The mop, which has a 4.1-star average rating from 2,148 reviews on Amazon, has a 30-minute runtime and works as a personal clothes steamer, too.
Type: corded | Cord length: 20 ft. | Water tank capacity: 11.8 fl. oz. | Handheld option: yes | Weight: 5.2 lbs. | Safe on: hardwood, tile, grout, clothing | Max temperature: 356 degrees
Bissell PowerFresh Deluxe Corded Steam Mop
- Long cord
- You can adjust steam pressure
- Fragrance disc not included
With this steam mop, you can choose how much steam to emit to clean messes of different levels and types. It’s effective at removing tacky food and drink spills and debris like dirt and mud, according to the brand. The end of the mop, which has a 4.4-star average rating from 19,886 reviews on Amazon, also has a small compartment above the mop pad to put a fragrance disc (not included), so you can release a scent onto your floors when cleaning.
Type: corded | Cord length: 25 ft. | Water tank capacity: 11.5 fl. oz. | Handheld option: yes | Weight: 6.2 lbs. | Safe on: hardwood, tile, laminate, marble, vinyl grout and stone | Max temperature: 194 degrees
Tineco Floor One S7 Steam Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Steam Mop
- Cordless
- Large water tank
- Somewhat heavy
Tineco’s Floor One brings together the best parts of a vacuum, mop and steam cleaner in one lightweight appliance.

Since it’s cordless, you can charge overnight and then have up to 40 minutes of runtime the next day. It also has dual water tanks to separate dirty water from clean, and an LED display to make using the appliance’s functions and cleaning modes simple.
Type: cordless | Cord length: n/a | Water tank capacity: 50 fl. oz. | Handheld option: no | Weight: 21.4 lbs. | Safe on: hardwood, tile, laminate, marble, vinyl | Max temperature: up to 284 degrees
How to shop for a steam mop
In addition to heat retention and bar pressure our experts recommend considering the following aspects when shopping for a steam mop:
Take safety precautions
Steam cleaners are effective for deep cleaning hard surfaces and upholstered furniture, especially compared to using a vacuum or scrub brush. That said, they’re also potentially dangerous if you use them improperly, for example, using it on clothes while you’re wearing them or steam cleaning unapproved surfaces.
Since it’s also possible to get small burns from using a steam cleaner, make sure you read the instruction manual before using one. You should also never put your hand in front of or near where the appliance emits steam and make sure it’s not facing toward you, such as near your legs or feet, or another person or pet.
Consider the size of your space
Like all steam cleaners, steam mops come with a water tank. Many models have different capacities, which means that the more water they hold, the longer they can emit steam without you having to refill it. This is more critical to consider if you plan on using one to clean a large house or room.

"CCT Demolition secures tailored invoice finance facility from Optimum Finance
CCT Demolition, which specialises in providing temporary labour for demolition and asbestos removal projects, has secured a customised invoice finance facility from Optimum Finance.
This strategic move aims to address the cash flow challenges inherent in the recruitment sector, particularly within the specialised fields of demolition and asbestos removal.
Optimum Finance said it has provided a solution tailored to CCT Demolition’s needs, offering an invoice finance facility that mitigates cash flow issues and equips the company for expansion.
Invoice finance allows businesses to access funds immediately based on the value of issued invoices, rather than waiting for client payments.
The recruitment nature of CCT Demolition necessitates consistent weekly payroll for temporary workers, a requirement that was creating a significant cash flow deficit due to delayed client payments. This financial gap was further exacerbated by a shrinking workforce in the industry and rising operational costs.
CCT Demolition founder and director Aidan Tait said: “Typically, temporary staff are paid weekly, but we often have to navigate through extended payment terms when 30 days frequently turns into 60. This means we face the challenge of paying out before we get paid ourselves. That, in turn, puts our cash flow under pressure and stifles our ability to grow.

By GlobalData“Working with Optimum has allowed us to bridge the gap between payment cycles, and pay staff and suppliers on time, with what is effectively our own money. It enables us to further strengthen our business position and grow, without the stress or hassle of chasing payments. And as we grow, so too does our invoice finance facility with Optimum.”
Tait aims to supply between 150 and 250 temporary workers each week to meet the demand, which represents a 200% increase over the current numbers.
“We provide between 75 and 100 temporary workers a week for sites placed all around the UK, from London to Manchester, and everything in between,” Tait continued.
“Having the financial flexibility to not only operate, but train and source new candidates is critical in our onward journey, and for us to continue to grow.”
Regarding the company’s relationship with Optimum Finance, he noted that the team’s support has been exceptionally valuable.
Tait concluded: “The Optimum name came with high recommendation. They quickly understood the unique position of our business and what we needed to achieve to be successful.”"
"Yunus says ‘looking forward’ to helping Bangladesh ‘get out of trouble’
Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus, who is due to head an interim government in Bangladesh after the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, said Wednesday he was looking forward to helping the country overcome its current turbulence.
“I’m looking forward to going back home, see what’s happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in,” he told reporters before boarding a flight at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport for Dubai where he was to connect to Dhaka.
He headed for the boarding zone pushing a small wheeled piece of luggage, waving goodbye.
The Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer will head the interim government after longtime and autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country.
The appointment came quickly after student leaders called on the 84-year-old Yunus — credited with lifting millions out of poverty in the South Asian country — to lead.
Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, resigned on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka demanding she stand down."

In today’s audio, we will talk about thermal power, domestic steel prices, private banks and key stocks to watch
Today's Latest Business News Transcript at 10:00 am on 8 August 2024
Let's begin... Thanks to the amendments added to the Finance Bill 2024 before it was passed by the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, the new regime for taxation of long-term capital gains from property transactions won’t result in any additional burden on the taxpayers, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday. The government eased the LTCG tax regime for sale of properties proposed in the Budget 2024-25 by allowing the taxpayer to select between two options – 12.5% without indexation and 20% with it — to lower the outgo, in regard to transfer of properties acquired before July 23, 2024. Sitharaman also clarified that the rollover benefit will be available to taxpayers who buy new immovable property utilising the capital gains on the sale of old property.
Next up, As the government looks at thermal power actively to mitigate the rising demand , private sector companies such as Adani Power, JSW Energy and Tata Power are looking at adding thermal capacities and launching new projects. Interestingly, some companies like Tata Power and JSW Energy, who have renewable energy as the main focus of their business, are now actively looking at the opportunities in the thermal energy space. Power companies refocusing on thermal capacity is not without a reason. The Union government is looking at over 80 gigawatt of new capacity additions in thermal by 2032 to meet the growing electricity demand. In the Union Budget, the FM proposed new thermal plants to be set up in the country to augment power supply.
Moving on, Domestic steel prices have tumbled to a 45-month low despite strong consumption, as falling exports and rising imports boosted supplies. The subdued prices, if not corrected, might derail the country’s ambition to have 300 million tonnes per annum steel-making installed capacity by 2030, as the margins of major manufacturers could come under pressure, industry executive say. However, lower steel prices may help combat inflation, as the alloy is key industrial raw material. Data compiled by rating agency ICRA show that at Rs 51,200 a tonne, the August (ex-works) price of the benchmark Hot rolled coil was at its lowest since November 2020, when it was Rs 45,975 a tonne in the Mumbai market.
In other news, Private banks have outperformed public sector banks in deposit growth during the first quarter. Private banks have increased their deposits by 12-35% year-on-year whereas public sector banks have only managed a growth range of 5-13%. With the deposit growth lagging the credit growth, both private and public lenders have raised deposit rates to attract more depositors. “Savings continue to be a challenge, and I think the saver-to-investor momentum continues and especially after elections, this has accentuated,” Shanti Ekambaram, deputy managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said in an earnings call. Among private banks, IDFC First Bank recorded a 36% Y-o-Y growth in deposits in the first quarter, followed by Bandhan Bank (23%) and Yes Bank (21%).
Next up, There is a plan to expand the scope of the India-Turkiye Air service agreement with the addition of new destinations, Turkish Airlines said on Wednesday. Speaking to Fe, Erkan Erdogan, general manager, northern and eastern India, said that as an airline, “we wish” to have revisions in current bilateral agreements with the civil aviation ministry for an expansion of the air service agreement. “There is huge potential in India that is not being realised because of the limited capacity. If the agreement allows, with our fleet availability, we would like to operate direct flights between Istanbul and major metro cities, which will also give an opportunity for Indians to explore our wide network operating in 130 countries,” Erdogan said.
Elsewhere, With Vodafone Idea infusing Rs 20,000 crore via follow-on public offering and equity contribution by one of the promoter entity, Aditya Birla Group, the government is now exploring whether sovereign wealth funds would be interested in picking up its stake in the company. Sources said that since the promoter group has shown sufficient interest in raising funds and running the company, and government fully backing the efforts, it makes sense for sovereign wealth funds to acquire government’s current 23.15% stake in the company. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority, Singapore’s Temasek, are some of the funds which have been sounded out, sources said, adding that the efforts are at a very initial stage.
Lastly, Stocks to watch include Hindalco, Godrej Consumer Product, Apollo Tyres, Radico Khaitan, NHPC, Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors and LIC. Furthermore, Hindalco subsidiary Novelis Inc reported a 2% year-on-year (YoY) increase in net sales for the first quarter, reaching $4.2 billion. This growth was primarily driven by higher average aluminium prices and increased total shipments. Total flat-rolled product shipments rose 8% to 951 kilotonnes compared to the same period last year. The FMCG major reported a 41.36% jump in profit after tax at Rs 450.69 crore for the June quarter of FY25. This marks a significant increase from the Rs 318.82 crore profit after tax (PAT) recorded in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year."

Mayor-President candidates kick earnings into high gear for second financial report
BATON ROUGE – Three months from the November election, the numbers are in for the most recent quarter’s campaign finance reports for the East Baton Rouge Mayor-President race. Candidates report all campaign donations since May.
While political experts say the total money earned doesn't tell who will win the race, it gives an idea of who’s supporting each candidate.
Political analyst James Hartman says over the next three months, campaign donations will continue to grow.
“If somebody writes you a $25,000 check, you know, maxes out your campaign, typically when they do that, they're done,” Hartman said. “When somebody writes a $25 check to your campaign, it means that's what they can afford, and they're really invested in your success.”
Campaign records show Incumbent Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome has raised $210,000 during the period. Ted James says he’s raised $310,000, which put him on track to once again outpace Broome in campaign contributions.
“With this fundraising quarter, we've exceeded our goals,” Mayor-President candidate Ted James said. “There's no mistake about it, our campaign is a grassroots campaign with over 1000 individual donations.”
Other candidates, like Republican Sid Edwards, raised more than $6,300. Nathaniel Hearn has close to $7,900, while Steve Myer and William Roundtree have $450 and $100 on hand at the end of the quarter. Ted James and Sharon Weston Broome are currently the two top contenders for the race.
""We saw an influx of hundreds of new low-dollar donors,"" M. E. Cormier with Sharon Weston Broome’s campaign said. ""The mayor has always been outraised in her mayoral campaigns, sometimes three to one. We're not concerned about how other donors donate.""

"Loan write-offs fall 27% in 5 years, public sector banks outperform private peers in recoveries
New Delhi: The quantum of loans written off by Indian banks every year fell more than 27 percent in 2023-24 as compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019-20, data provided by the Ministry of Finance shows.
Further, an analysis of the data shows public sector banks (PSBs) have done significantly better than their private and foreign peers, accounting for a falling share in overall written-off loans and a higher success rate in recovering these loans. That said, the level of recoveries still remains low, at 18.6 percent for the entire banking sector.
Notably, especially in light of the allegations faced by the government over these write-offs benefiting only large corporates, the data shows that large industry accounts for a falling share of written-off loans, both at the aggregate level as well as for just PSBs.
The data on loan write-offs and recoveries was submitted to the Rajya Sabha by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary in reply to two separate questions.
A loan write-off is a technical requirement imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), wherein a bank has to make provisions for a defaulted loan, and then move it off the balance sheet. The process of recovering these loans continues, unlike with a loan waiver.
The argument in favour of this practice is that it frees up the balance sheet so that further lending can take place.

Falling write-offs, rising recoveries
The data submitted to the Rajya Sabha, sourced by the finance ministry from the RBI, shows that the total amount written off by banks fell from Rs 2.3 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2023-24, a 27 percent fall.
Further, the PSBs account for a falling share of these amounts that have been written off — from 75 percent in 2019-20 to 67 percent in 2023-24.
Over the years, the Congress party has taken swipes at the government over the issues of write-offs, saying that not only are these meant to favour large corporates, but also that the recovery of these loans has been paltry.
The data does show that, of the total amount written off in the last five years, only 18.5 percent has so far been recovered. However, PSBs perform better than their private and foreign peers here.
The public sector banks increased their share in the amount recovered from 64 percent in 2019-20 to nearly 81 percent in 2023-24. In other words, of every Rs 100 recovered by the entire banking sector in 2023-24, Rs 81 was recovered by PSBs.
Deeper look at recovery ratios
Another way to look at the recovery performance is to see what proportion of loans written off by each bank category has been recovered. Here, too, PSBs outperform.
The public sector banks have so far recovered 21.3 percent of the amount they themselves have written off in the last five years. This share is 13.7 percent for private and foreign banks.
Yet another way to look at the write-off and recovery behaviour of banks is to measure the recovery ratio — the amount recovered in a year as a percentage of the amount of fresh write-offs done that year. This shows whether recoveries are growing faster or slower than write-offs.
Here, the PSBs have displayed a strong performance, steadily increasing this ratio from 10.9 percent in 2019-20 to 31.6 percent in 2023-24, showing that recoveries have consistently grown faster than fresh write-offs.
Private banks, on the other hand, have seen this ratio rise and fall over the five years, but remain largely unchanged in 2023-24 compared to 2019-20.
Write-offs of large industry loans falling
Loans to large industry and services — as opposed to micro, small and medium enterprises — comprise a falling share of the amounts written off every year by all banks. These large industry loans made up 68 percent of the loans that were written off by the banking sector in 2019-20, and it fell to about 42 percent by 2023-24.
Within this, loans to large industries made up more than 75 percent of the loans written off by PSBs in 2019-20. This has since fallen to 53 percent, indicating that a rising share of the write-offs have been on account of loans to other categories of borrowers.

"Florida Buyers Told to 'Be Careful' in Housing Market by Real Estate Expert
A real estate expert has warned Florida homebuyers to be careful as the state's housing market undergoes changes.
The state remains one of the country's toughest housing markets as buyers deal with sky-high interest rates and demand. However, real estate expert Nick Gerli is cautioning buyers that the market could look very different in the last half of 2024. He is the CEO of housing market data platform Reventure App.
Inventory in Florida now is at its highest level in at least seven years, Gerli wrote on X (formerly Twitter), based on Reventure's data. There were 141,000 active listings in July, a whopping 70 percent boost from last year. The listings were up 276 percent from the pandemic's low.
More From Newsweek Vault: How to Calculate How Much House You Can Afford
""These type of inventory gains are huge and suggest big downward price pressure in H2 2024,"" Gerli continued on X. ""Be careful if you're buying in Florida.""
Some regions of Florida saw more significant inventory increases than others. The Tampa metro area grew 94 percent year over year, with Orlando, Jacksonville and Miami not far behind, ranging from 72 to 79 percent increases.
More From Newsweek Vault: Should I Buy a House Now or Wait? How to Determine the Right Time to Get a Mortgage
""The more that inventory piles up in a short span of time, the bigger the potential for price drops,"" Gerli said.
The year-over-year drop in list prices in Central to West Florida ranged from 2 to 9 percent, which Gerli called ""progress, but nothing monumental.""
But in Miami, which has been one of the most competitive housing markets in recent years, list prices dropped the most, by 11 percent.
Gerli said several factors make it more likely that inventory will rise, from the massive home-building pipeline that popped up in the state to skyrocketing insurance premiums and homeowner association fees forcing owners to sell.
""I also think there's likely to be stagnating demand in Florida for the next several years due to the 'pull-forward' effect during the pandemic. Meaning - the pandemic accelerated the purchase decisions of many households in Florida,"" Gerli wrote on X.
""Maybe some people who would have eventually bought in 2024 or 2025 actually bought in 2021-22 because pandemic motivated them to do it. The result now is a demand vacuum where we are likely to see fewer buyers for the next several years from a structural stand point,"" he wrote.
While Gerli acknowledged that list prices have come down only moderately and still have a ""long way to go"" before buyers feel the market is affordable, the current inventory could indicate major changes are on the horizon.
Alex Beene, a consumer literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: ""Housing markets throughout the United States have dealt with more difficulties for sellers in the form of higher prices and interest rates keeping buyers away, but Florida has been hit especially hard because of dramatically rising insurance prices, as well.
""There's also the reality we're no longer in the pandemic era, and the appeal of moving to Florida to avoid a state with stronger restrictions is no longer there. It's the perfect storm of problems to create more inventory and potential long-term issues for Florida's housing market,"" Beene said.
Beene said sellers should not panic, though.
""Despite these issues, there are still plenty of buyers,"" he said. ""So much of housing sales in general will hinge on the Fed's coming decisions on interest rates. If you can afford to hold on a tad longer, wait for interest rates to lower to make a potential home sale easier.""
Michael Ryan, a Florida-based finance expert and founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, said the surge in inventory is likely not just a blip on the radar.
""It has all the makings of a seismic shift, which could reshape the real estate market landscape,"" Ryan told Newsweek. ""As usual, developers got a bit too excited during the boom. They are literally building an entire city west of West Palm Beach of 5,000 homes.""
With more inventory, prices are likely to get squeezed and course-correct from the extreme highs sustained during the pandemic.
""During the pandemic, we saw a Florida gold rush,"" Ryan said. ""Everyone and their cousin wanted a piece of the Sunshine State. But now? That well might be running dry.""
In the short term, this could mean a market recalibration, but Ryan is hesitant to say the lower prices will continue long term.
""Prices might wobble, but Florida's fundamental appeal hasn't changed,"" he said. ""Sunshine, no state income tax—these aren't going away.""

"Kenyan protesters are demanding President Ruto be removed – what the law says about how that could happen
In June 2024, many Kenyans took to the streets to protest what they believed were punitive taxes imposed by President William Ruto’s government. Though the president caved in and withdrew the contentious Finance Bill 2024, protesters are unmoved and now insist that he leave office.
No Kenyan president has ever been removed prematurely from office.
The opposition, led by the Azimio La Umoja Coalition, set out to collect 10 million signatures in 2023. This was part of an effort to pressure Ruto to step down. This signature-gathering effort, however, has no constitutional relevance to the removal of a Kenyan president from office.
Kenya’s democratic constitution is quite clear on how a sitting president can be removed from office. As a legal expert and economist who studies the rule of law and democratisation in Africa, I outline what the law says about how Ruto could, in theory, be removed from office.
The constitution of Kenya guides the process. There are only two legal routes to remove a president before the end of his or her term: on the grounds of incapacity (Article 144) or impeachment (Article 145).
The process can be lengthy and complicated. However, as Kenya is a democracy, those who believe that Ruto has failed them as president can deny him a second term in the country’s next general election in 2027.
Removal on grounds of incapacity
The removal of a president from office because he or she no longer has the physical or mental capacity to perform the functions of the office may be carried out by a majority of the 349 members of the Kenyan national assembly, which is one of two houses of parliament.
First, a member of the national assembly, who is supported by at least 25% of all the members, can move a motion to investigate the president’s physical or mental capacity to perform his or her constitutional functions.
If that motion is supported by a majority of all members of the national assembly, then the speaker can inform the country’s chief justice of the resolution within two days.
After receiving notice of the resolution, the chief justice or deputy chief justice has seven days to appoint a special tribunal to investigate the matter.
The special tribunal must consist of five individuals. These are three qualified Kenyan medical practitioners, one advocate of the high court and an individual nominated by the president.
The report of the tribunal must be submitted to the chief justice and the speaker of the national assembly within 14 days. The report is considered final and is not subject to appeal (Article 144(8)).
The speaker must then table the report before the national assembly within seven days.
If the tribunal concludes that the president doesn’t have the capacity to perform the functions of his or her office, the national assembly must vote on whether to ratify the report. If the majority vote to ratify the report, this will automatically result in the president’s removal from office.
Removal by impeachment
A member of the national assembly may move a motion to impeach a sitting president. The motion must be supported by at least one third of all members (Article 145(1)).
A sitting president may be impeached
on the ground of a gross violation of a provision of the constitution or of any other law
where there are serious reasons for believing that the president has committed a crime under national or international law
for gross misconduct.
If the motion to impeach the president is supported by at least two-thirds of all 349 members of the national assembly (or at least 232 members), the speaker then transmits the resolution to the speaker of the senate (the upper house of parliament) within two days.
Within seven days of receiving the notice of the impeachment resolution from the speaker of the national assembly, the speaker of the senate must call the senate to order to hear and investigate the charges against the president.
The senate may pass a resolution to appoint a special committee, which is made up of 11 of its members, to investigate the charges against the president. The special committee has 10 days to investigate the matter and report to the senate.
The president and his or her legal counsel are allowed to appear before the special committee during investigations. If the special committee determines and reports to the senate that
the particulars of any allegation against the President — (a) have not been substantiated, further proceedings shall not be taken under Article 145 in respect of that allegation; or (b) have been substantiated, the Senate shall, after according the President an opportunity to be heard, vote on the impeachment charges.
If at least two-thirds of the 67 members of the senate vote in favour of upholding any of the impeachment charges, the president’s mandate will be terminated.
The likelihood of the opposition securing the numbers needed to get these processes going are slim. Presently, of the 349 seats in the national assembly, 179 are held by the government, 158 by the opposition and 12 by independents. In the senate, the government and opposition each hold 33 seats, with one seat being vacant.
Once a president is removed
What would happen should the senate convict and remove the president from office? The constitution says the deputy president shall assume office for the remainder of the term of the president (Article 146(2)).
However, if the deputy president is unable to assume the office of president, the speaker of the national assembly shall serve as president. An election for president must then be held within 60 days after the vacancy is created (Article 146(2)(b)).
Democracy and the rule of law
To safeguard against opportunistic interference with the ability of a democratically elected president to perform his or her functions, Kenya’s constitution defines and enshrines very specific grounds for the removal of a sitting president.
Popular discontent or dissatisfaction with the performance of the president isn’t one of these grounds.
The mass protests against the Ruto regime are an expression of Kenyans’ frustration and dissatisfaction with the performance of their government.
While Kenyans, through their elected officials, have the tools to terminate the president’s mandate early, they might want to seriously consider the consequences this would have on their democracy in general and future administrations in particular.
Ruto has been in office for less than two years. Civil society and the protest movement might want to adopt a more constructive approach that seeks increased participation in policy design and implementation. Additionally, Kenyans can exercise their right to oust the regime in 2027 by denying it the votes that it needs to be re-elected."
"Lok Sabha Passes Bill To Amend Long Term Tax Provision On Properties
The Lower House later approved the Finance Bill with 45 official amendments. (File)
New Delhi: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Finance Bill 2024 after the government relaxed the just-introduced new capital gains tax on real estate, allowing taxpayers an option to switch to a new lower tax rate or stay with the old regime that had higher rate with indexation benefit.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who in her Budget for 2024-25 proposed to lower the long-term capital gains tax on real estate to 12.5 per cent from 20 per cent but without the indexation benefit, moved an amendment to the bill to give the option. Indexation benefit allows taxpayers to arrive at the cost price of the property after adjusting for inflation.
The amendment came after the new provision was criticised for raising tax incidence and disincentivizing investments in the real estate.
The major amendment in the Bill relates to restoration of indexation benefit on sale of properties bought prior to July 23, 2024. Now, individuals or HuFs who purchased houses before July 23, 2024, can opt to pay LTCG tax under the new scheme at the rate of 12.5 per cent without indexation or claim the indexation benefit and pay 20 per cent tax.
The Lower House later approved the bill with 45 official amendments by voice vote.
The Finance Bill 2024 will now go to the Rajya Sabha for discussion but the Upper House does not have powers, as per the Constitution, to reject a money bill. It only can return such bills and if they don't do so within the stipulated 14 days, the legislation is considered as approved.
Nirmala Sitharaman also said that the FY25 Budget proposals were aimed at promoting investment and benefiting the middle class.
She said that the hike in tax exemption limit on long-term capital gains in listed equities and bonds to Rs 1.25 lakh from Rs 1 lakh will benefit the middle class investing in stock markets.
The Modi government, she said, has brought in a simplified taxation regime and eased compliance without drastically increasing taxes. The reduction in customs duty on various goods will promote trade and investment and generate employment, she added.
Responding to demands for the removal of GST on health and life insurance premiums, Nirmala Sitharaman said that 75 per cent of the GST collected goes to states.
Prior to levying 18 per cent GST on health insurance (premium), all states used to levy tax on insurance premiums. So when GST was rolled out, the tax automatically got subsumed into GST, Nirmala Sitharaman said.

"State refuses to back down as rise in road levy continues to hurt motorists
The government has admitted that Kenyans are paying at least Sh4 more per litre of super petrol and diesel following the upward review of the controversial road maintenance levy (RML) last month.
The pump price of diesel got the worst hit with motorists having to pay at least Sh5.20 more after the imposition of the levy.
Petroleum Principal Secretary Mohamed Liban said that before the revision of the RML, the projected prices of super petrol and diesel were to be reduced by Sh5.27 per litre and Sh6.74 per litre, respectively.
However, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) last month announced a drop of only Sh1 for super petrol and Sh1.50 for diesel in the pricing cycle covering between July 15 and August 14, 2024.
The price changes mean consumers in Nairobi have been paying a maximum of Sh188.84 for a litre of super petrol and Sh171.60 for a litre of diesel.
“Prior to the revision of the RML, the projected price of super petrol, diesel and kerosene were to reduce by Sh5.27 per litre, Sh6.74 per litre and Sh0.23 per litre, respectively,” said Mr Liban in a documented submitted to the Senate Energy committee.
“However, pursuant to the notice of July 10 by (former Roads cabinet secretary) Kipchumba Murkomen, Epra had to include the revised rates of the RML in the computation of applicable prices for the period between July 15 and August 14, 2024,” he added.
Potential price decrease
The development comes after the committee chaired by Nyeri Senator Wahome Wamatinga pushed for an explanation of the potential price decrease that the upward revision of the levy denied customers.
This came at a time when the reduction of the weighted average cost for all imports dropped by Sh7.33 per litre of petrol and Sh4.05 per litre of diesel compared to the previous pricing cycle.
However, PS Liban said the computation of petroleum pump prices considers the landed cost which is the weighted average costs of imported super petrol, diesel and kerosene; storage and distribution costs, gross margins and applicable taxes and levies.
In effect, he pointed out that the gazette notice by Mr Murkomen, which came into effect on July 15, 2024, led to an upward revision of pump price on both super petrol and diesel by Sh7 per litre.
“This therefore means that the impact on the pump is an increase of Sh8.12 per litre inclusive of value added tax,” he said.
The committee also wanted to know whether Epra conducted public participation on the impact of increasing the levy on the pump price.
The PS, however, said Section 3(1) of the Road Maintenance Levy Fund Act provides that the minister (in charge of Roads and Transport), in consultation with the minister for the time being responsible for finance, by order published in the Gazette, impose on any or all petroleum fuels entered for home use in Kenya a road maintenance levy which may be determined from time to time and in such manner as the minister may specify in the Order.
“Public participation was therefore not to be conducted by Epra but the minister responsible for reviewing the Roads Maintenance Levy as provided for in the Act,” he said.
Controversy has, nonetheless, continued to stalk the levy increase with different stakeholders calling for its reversal.
The Law Society of Kenya termed the Sh7 per litre hike illegal and unconstitutional, saying it was done without proper Parliamentary scrutiny hence a blatant breach of constitutional provision.
Billions of shillings
“The LSK calls for the immediate reversal of this unconstitutional and procedural action, failure to which we will take such measures as may be necessary to ensure full compliance with the law by the government,” said the LSK President Ms Faith Odhiambo.
“We were not in support of the proposal to increase the levy, even the ministry expressed reservations only to see that it has been effected,” said Job Wanjohi, head of policy research and advocacy at Kenya Association of Manufacturers.
“We need a legal opinion on it to understand if it was done right in terms of its implementation.”
Motorists have also questioned the rationale behind the increment of the levy, arguing that the Ministry of Transport has little to show on how it has deployed billions of shillings raised under the levy.
“This (increment of the levy to Sh25 per litre) is despite submitted objections from the stakeholders and the general public,” the Motorist Association of Kenya said Monday.
However, the government has defended the hike, saying it hopes to raise upwards of Sh115 billion by June next year from the higher RML to boost the pool of funds available to maintain the country’s 239,122-kilometre road network."
"Super Rare Games’ CEO reveals dream projects, Nintendo Switch 2 hopes
Super Rare Games is fueled by a celebrative attitude for all things indie games, championing both acclaimed ‘game of the year’ contenders and overlooked gems across nearly every platform sitting in your entertainment system right now. The landscape is constantly changing, though, as Super Rare Games’ CEO George Perkins is keenly aware it needs to keep up with how players are evolving alongside the games too.
I caught up with Perkins recently for a chat about Super Rare Games’ approach to selecting titles, dream projects, and the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2.
The last time I spoke to Super Rare Games was when the mixtapes launched, and a lot has happened since then. What do you think is the biggest difference between the vision for Super Rare Games then, compared to now?
George Perkins: “I think over the years, our overall aim has remained the same: how can we support small, independent games developers, whether that’s additional exposure, financing or mentoring.
What’s changed the most is the extent to how we act on these points. Now we can fully finance a project, deliver the highest level of physical publishing around, whilst also using our extensive knowledge of games to help create the best possible titles.”
I think it’s fair to say that Super Rare Games relishes in offering up niche games to both newcomers and dedicated players alike. How do you navigate choosing to work on games you personally love, while trying to offer players something you believe they’d enjoy?
GP: “My taste in games usually is what will shine through in our portfolio. I am in charge of signing games, so naturally my bias comes through! The last couple of years, I have tried to diversify what we do to a higher extent, meaning working on games that may be in genres that I don’t naturally gravitate towards. The best example being that I am incredibly easy to scare, so I generally can’t play horror games! There are a few exceptions like the Supermassive [Games] titles, where I can hide behind a pillow whilst my friends have the controller!”
Similarly, what do you look for in games to sign up to Super Rare these days, as opposed to when the company started?
GP: “The main thing I always look for in games is personality. I want to work on games which make players feel something special and leave a lasting effect. All our games have a unique feeling about them, whether they are well known or hidden gems. For me, being able to increase the exposure of smaller titles is the most rewarding part of my job.”
There’s been a large shift toward digital purchases in the last decade, with even triple-A titles like Alan Wake 2 completely avoiding a physical release until post-launch. Do you see this as a barrier or are there advantages to publishing purely in the digital space?
GP: “Physical releases bring a lot of logistical issues, more notably in larger titles which are sold across 1,000’s of retailers across multiple continents. The few, obvious ones are: higher cost to print and distribute a physical version, higher risk if you don’t sell what you print, will not contain patches / DLC if you buy it early, multiple age ratings to submit, and a lot of secondary parties who all take a cut from the process. So with all of that, I understand why a company would avoid it.
We are specifically designed to combat those issues. We sell directly to consumers, which gives us a lot more control over quantities we produce, as well as keeping the margins for developers much higher. We also add a lot of extra items to the titles we make physically, so it means that physical and digital releases of the same game have the same profit margin for the developers.”
Looking ahead into the future, the Nintendo Switch 2 is on the horizon. How is Super Rare Games preparing for it, and what are you looking forward to when it debuts?
GP: “We still know very little about what a new Nintendo console will look like, but it’s certainly exciting! As a lifelong fan of them, it’s always a special moment when they release a new bit of hardware. I just hope there will be a mainline 3D Mario game – Mario 64, Sunshine, and Odyssey are a few of my favorite games of all time!
From a company standpoint, being able to bring new games to the platform, and start our collection of games from scratch is something I am looking forward to! There will be some logistical considerations as we transition from the Switch to something new, but ultimately a process we are excited for!”
As a publisher, do you think Nintendo’s eShop gives players enough incentive to dive into indie games, and is there anything you’d like to see change in the future?
GP: “Steam has always been a very algorithmic platform, which while not perfect, allows a lot of smaller games to reach a massive audience without an extensive marketing reach. While storefronts on traditional consoles (such as the eShop) still provide great opportunities, the fact that a lot of the placements of titles are manually selected, and spaces like charts are dominated by AAA games and such, does mean it is way harder for a very small, self-published game the chance to reach a large amount of people.
The solutions to these problems are hard to specifically pick out, further work on genre-specific searching and ‘suggested’ titles based on preference in games, would be a good start.”
Is there one game that you’re still chasing to sign up, or one that has gotten away in the past?
GP: “A lot of what I would have wanted to release, either us or another publisher has released! The most recent indie game I have played and fell in love with, was The Case of the Golden Idol. I really want to work on that one! Titles we have missed out on, that I would have wanted to have worked on, are Celeste and Hollow Knight, but we were very young as a company when they were released, so I completely understand why we couldn’t get them!”
Lastly, are there specific titles in the Super Rare Games’ library you’re particularly proud of to have worked on?
GP: “The two that jump to mind are A Short Hike and Sally Face. The first because it was one of my favorite games, so getting to spend two years to create an amazing physical release was an amazing experience! With the latter, it was my younger brother’s favorite game! He was completely obsessed with the game, so getting to surprise him with a collectors edition was amazing.”
Super Rare Games will next release a physical edition of Lil’ Guardsman for Nintendo Switch on Thursday, August 8, 2024. You could even snag yourself a copy for free if you’re quick enough to enter Super Rare Games’ latest giveaway.
Got a hankering to dive into many of the best Switch games now? We’re feeling it too. Keep the vibes going by diving into our list of all the free Switch games available, and keep updated with all the new Switch games on the horizon."

"Do bulk deposits benefit banks?
The current hike in the limits of bulk deposits has been triggered by sluggish growth in bank deposits rapid growth in bank loans, recently. Year-on-year, during 2022-23 and 2023-24, aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) grew by 9.6 per cent and 12.9 per cent respectively, whereas bank credit grew by 15 per cent and 16.3 per cent. The new norms also break the definitional status quo maintained for over five years.
Following its announcement in the June 7, 2024, ‘Developmental and Regulatory Policies’, RBI notified the new definition of bulk deposits (BDs) as:
A) Single rupee term deposits (TDs) of ‘₹3 crore and above’ for SCBs (excluding regional rural banks — RRBs) and small finance banks; and
B) Single rupee TDs of ‘₹1 crore and above’ for RRBs and local area banks.
BDs were first defined on March 3, 2016, according to which ‘A’ stood at ‘₹1 crore and above’ and ‘B’ at ‘₹15 lakh and above’. From February 22, 2019, ‘A’ stood at ‘₹2 crore and above’ and ‘B’ at ‘₹15 lakh and above’. Interest rates offered on BDs are ‘same as or higher than’ those on retail deposits in the comparable maturity categories. Post-announcement, many banks have revised their interest rates on BDs.
In general, BDs source from high net-worth individuals and non-individual entities like government, public and private sector corporates, rich trusts, non-banks and societies. The revised limit will increase banks’ retail TDs, at least statistically, and allow banks to release human and technological resources to garner BDs.
Bulk deposits data
Banks don’t publish their BD data; instead, they publish ‘deposits with 20 largest depositors’ in the ‘Notes to the Account’ of their balance sheets.
However, RBI’s Basic Statistical Returns-2 provides size-wise distribution of TDs according to ownership by ‘number of accounts’ and ‘amount outstanding’ for the banking system. From this database we collated TDs which are ‘₹1 crore and above’ (let’s call it ‘target category’) in order to obtain a fair idea about the number of accounts and amount of BDs. The highlights of our data analysis covering 2019 to 2024 (March-end) are discussed below.
At March-end 2024, the number of accounts and amount stood at 8,10,000 and ₹50,55,870 crore, respectively, in the ‘target category’ with their respective compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) during 2019-24 at 11.8 per cent and 14.5 per cent, exceeding the corresponding CAGRs posted by the total TD portfolio.
Both by number of accounts and amount, ‘non-individuals’ commanded a lion’s share in the ‘target category’.
In terms of amount, CAGR for ‘non-individuals’ in the ‘target category’ at 15 per cent crossed that for ‘individuals’ at 8.6 per cent. However, by number of accounts, CAGR for the former was lower (11.1 per cent) than the latter (13.9 per cent).
During 2019 to 2024, the shares of the ‘target group’ by the number of accounts remained as low as 0.19 per cent to 0.33 per cent of the total number of TD accounts; however, they commanded as high as 37 per cent to 43.7 per cent of the total TDs’ amount (see Table). This indicated high inequality in the distribution of TDs.
Exercise discipline
An overwhelming part of BDs is uninsured. For example, the current deposit insurance limit at ₹5 lakh covers as little as 1.67 per cent of BDs worth ₹3 crore. Therefore, bulk depositors not only search for fundamentally strong banks but also monitor their activities regularly and closely, unlike the retail depositors. If bulk depositors observe weaknesses in their banks, they will likely migrate their deposits to other perceivably stronger banks.
Thus, bulk depositors are in a position to exercise discipline on their banks. In order to retain bulk depositors, banks even treat them with prestige.
Risks of bulk depositors
BDs, generally, are considered as potentially volatile. Bulk depositors receiving higher interest rates, but not maintaining any other significant or stable relationship with a bank (say, as borrowers), can exit anytime, if deposit interest rates decline, or if they are offered further higher rates or better facilities by other banks.
Walkouts, even by a few big depositors, despite the bank remaining safe and sound, may be misinterpreted by general depositors, if they come to know about it, as something is wrong with the bank, which may also get exacerbated through rumours.
After the Lehman collapse in 2008 Q3, in India, a major corporate transferred ₹1,000 crore deposits from a large private bank to a large public sector bank. Following the corporate’s disclosure and newspaper reports of the event, long queues were seen outside the private bank’s ATMs in major cities, even though the bank was safe and sound. Besides, BDs are vulnerable to window-dressing by banks, in many ways, towards the accounting year-end.
For instance, it’s easier to ask a few large customers to not withdraw their deposits towards the accounting year-end than to ask millions of retail depositors to do so.
One way to mitigate the risks is to focus on those bulk depositors who maintain durable relationship with the bank and in various capacities. Further, banks should, among other things, actively monitor BD accounts and their premature closing. Supervisory authorities during their inspections of banks should also take note of BDs and activities therein.
In order to impart stability to their deposit portfolios, banks should contract more of non-callable BDs with long maturity periods. Banks should also disclose comprehensive data on BDs in their balance sheets. The RBI’s BSR-2 data on size-wise distribution of TDs should give data for ‘₹3 crore and above’, following the revision.

Money Experts Julien and Kiersten Saunders: 3 Ways To Raise a ‘Rich’ Kid
Being a parent is no easy task, especially when it comes to finances. While parents must stay on top of their finances, it’s equally as important to help your kids stay on track with theirs, too.

A CNBC + Acorns survey indicated that only 16% of parents talk to their children about personal finances once a month, 24% speak to them less often, and 31% never talk to their kids about finances at all.
Since personal finance education isn’t always the norm in the U.S., teaching your kids about personal finance from a young age should be a priority. It can be daunting to have the money conversation with your kids, there’s no doubt about it. But, it’s absolutely crucial. Fortunately, there are some tips and tricks you can follow as a parent to ensure your children’s finances are in order.
Financial gurus Julien and Kiersten Saunders explained in a recent post on their website, Rich & Regular, that there are three key ways to raise a rich kid.

Earning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.
Set Limits
Teaching your kids about financial limits early will instill discipline and good habits. Setting spending limits means your child can grow a significant safety net over time. This way, when they reach adulthood, the discipline they’ve developed — plus the safety net they already have in place — will set them on the right track as soon as they become financially independent.

Make Saving Money Normal
As a parent, it’s important to make saving money normal. Starting both savings and investment accounts with money your kid receives as gifts from birth through young adulthood will allow the funds to grow and compound over time. Additionally, developing excellent financial habits yourself will set a good example for your children as they develop their habits.
Invest Early and Often
Investing early and often is the key to long-term wealth accumulation. The earlier you start, the more your money will grow over time. Starting early means that your child will need less money to grow their wealth to the same level as someone who starts saving and investing many years later. Time is on your side when you’re very young, so help your kids take full advantage.

"Being fired decreases your salary by 26% over 11 years, Finance Ministry reveals
The yearly income of workers in Israel who are fired drops by 45% in the year after they have lost their jobs, according to research released by the Finance Ministry Wednesday, which is the first in a three-part series.
Yearly income for these workers recovers over the subsequent years following their firing, but a gap of 10-20% remains 10 years after their firing, the ministry found.
These hits to their income translate to a 26% income loss in the 11 years following their firing, the report found.The chances of an employee who has been fired being hired decrease by 25% in the first year after they are fired, and drop 7% in the long run.
The research also found an increase in the income of the partner of the employee who was fired, which is similar to what is seen in the literature in other countries.
Comparison to Europe
This increase in income for partners is only statistically significant in the short run and only partially compensates for the loss of income from their partner’s firing.
The short-run damage to fired employees is slightly higher in Israel than in a number of European countries when compared to similar research on firings. In the long run, the damage is similar.
The research was completed using an analysis of mass firing events between 1999 and 2009."
"Softbank Group errs on the side of caution after Q1 profit
Bengaluru: Softbank Group struck a cautious tone for future investments even as it swung to a profit in the April-June quarter aided by gains in some of its tech stocks which helped offset its other losses.
“Since a very tough time last year when we had shifted to the offence mode, we are back in the investment mode. But at the same time, we are very selective and very careful in discussions with the investment committee to make sure that we carefully select the investee companies for vision fund II,” SoftBank finance chief Yoshimitsu Goto said in the earnings call.
While the two Vision Funds including LatAm funds cumulatively made investment gains of $12 million, Softbank’s Vision Fund 2 made a loss of $2.6 billion. The first vision fund made a profit of $2.8 billion. Overall, Softbank Group reported a first-quarter net profit of ¥10.5 billion from a loss of ¥316.2 billion in the same period a year earlier. Its net sales grew 9.3% to ¥1.7 trillion.
The vision funds also generated liquidity of about $0.8 billion in the first quarter from some of its investments through full exits in companies including SenseTime and Paytm and partial exits from other portfolio companies. The investment firm also plans to buy back about $3.4 billion in shares as it faces increased pressure from investors including Elliott Management to improve its stock price, as per several media reports.
The Japanese technology investor is also systematically shedding its stake in China’s Alibaba. “Four years ago, we were concentrated on China, namely Alibaba. But now we are looking at Europe more than any other regions to mitigate the risk of China-centric position,” Goto said, adding that the group’s share has been reducing over the last three years.
The company also stands to benefit from several growth-stage IPO bound companies from its vision funds. Some of its Indian portfolio companies that are looking to go public include FirstCry, Unicommerce, Swiggy, Ola Electric and Ola across the two funds. Its other most valued investments include Flipkart and Lenskart.
Softbank is particularly bullish about artificial intelligence (AI) and is keen on building a robust pipeline of companies that are built on this technology. Some of its investments in AI over the last year include Perplexity, AlphaSense, Wiz and Tractable.
The group is seeing a growing use case of AI adoption across its portfolio companies including Grab, Klarna, Meesho and ByteDance. For instance, Meesho is using GenAI in customer support operations, which has resulted in a 20% improvement in customer experience scoring while Klarna is leveraging a GenAI assistant to handle almost 70% of customer queries, driving $40 million profit improvement.

"A popular trading strategy just blew up in investors’ faces
A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.
Sometimes, markets tumble because of a big, unambiguous event, like a pandemic or a war or an economic slowdown. Sometimes, they fall because of less visible forces, like high-level financial shenanigans designed to generate profits out of thin air.
This week, markets have been grappling with both.
The selloff on Wall Street began last week with some fundamental concerns: Tech earnings were disappointing, and there were red flags in the US labor market that could indicate a serious slowdown in the world’s biggest economy.
But the financial shift that poured gasoline on the fire is more obscure, and so technical that even some longtime investors struggle to explain it succinctly.
When you hear commentators talking this week about the “yen carry trade” or the “great unwind,” they’re referring to a popular trading strategy that is, suddenly, blowing up in investors’ faces.
The carry trade, explained
Put simply: A carry trade is when you borrow money in a place where interest rates are low and use it to invest elsewhere in assets that generate some kind of return.
For years, the place to get money on the cheap has been Japan, where interest rates have held steadily at or near zero.
An investor could borrow Japanese yen (for a small fee) and use that yen to buy, say, US tech stocks or government bonds or the Mexican peso — all of which have offered solid returns in recent years. In theory, as long as the yen remains low against the dollar, you can pay back what you borrowed and still walk away with a tidy profit.
“For the century so far, you would have made more money in the yen-peso carry trade than you would have done in the S&P 500,” Bloomberg columnist John Authers said on the Big Take Daily podcast. “That is bonkers.”
The yen carry trade proved especially popular in the last four years, because Japan was the only major economy in the world offering essentially free money. (While the US, Europe and others were raising interest rates to fight inflation, Japan has had the opposite problem, and it kept borrowing rates low to encourage economic growth.)
Borrowing for next to nothing and getting a 5% return on a US Treasury sounds like a no-brainer.
“It’s pretty good arbitrage, but it’s not really arbitrage because it’s not risk-free,” said John Sedunov, a finance professor at the Villanova School of Business. “You need to have the exchange rate work in your favor.”
Easy money turns messy
Problems began when the yen’s value started going up a few weeks ago, eroding the potential profit from a carry trade.
Last week, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the second time since March, pushing the yen even higher (and thus making it more expensive to pay back your yen-based loan).
Meanwhile, the dollar weakened as the Federal Reserve strongly hinted at looming rate cuts, and US tech stocks declined. If you’re a carry trader, you headed for the exits. But so did everyone else.
This is where it gets messy.
“You can’t unwind the biggest carry trade the world has ever seen without breaking a few heads,” Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Societe Generale, said in a note to clients Monday.
The carry trade relies on borrowing, which means it’s a leveraged position. (As a general rule, whenever you hear of leverage in finance, think “high risk.”)
Once even minor losses start to accrue, lenders are going to demand that you pony up more cash to cover your potential losses, a process known as a margin call. That may mean selling stocks to raise cash, or closing out the position completely.
“Not everybody will have a margin call at once, but the riskiest people might, and then they start to liquidate,” Sedunov said. “And then that creates losses for people down the chain, and then they have to sell things, and then it’s just this kind of spiral.”
On Monday, the Japanese stock market fell 12.4%, triggering a global rout. On Tuesday, Japan’s stocks clawed back some of their losses. US markets also rebounded. But the relief may be temporary.
“We are not done by any stretch,” Arindam Sandilya, co-head of global FX strategy for JPMorgan Chase, said on Bloomberg TV. “The carry trade unwind… is somewhere between 50%-60% complete.”
In other words: Buckle up, and don’t panic."
"Steps that can reduce IBC delays
The Banking Law Reforms Committee (BLRC) which gave birth to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) categorically stated that “speed is of essence for the working of IBC”. After seven years of implementation, the IBC is beset with a basic problem — absence of timeliness.
According to Crisil Ratings, recovery rates under IBC have fallen from 43 per cent to 32 per cent between March 2019 and September 2023, while the average resolution time has increased from 324 to 653 days versus the stipulated 330 days.
While the data regarding the timeliness are available post commencement of Corporate Insolvency resolution process (CIRP), similar data for pre-commencement of CIRP, i.e. the time taken from the date of filing application till the date of order commencing CIRP, are not available.
The latter is particularly critical, especially when the applications are filed by banks both under Section 7 (against the corporate debtor) and Section 95 (against the personal guarantor) of IBC.
Quicker admission into CIRP can check value erosion caused by the unscrupulous promoters during that period. Fearing the loss of control over their company, promoters resort to all sorts of unethical means which results in huge value erosion. Delays have far-reaching ramifications be it at the pre- or post-admission stage.
Three steps
Hence, strengthening each area concerned with CIRP is critical to reduce delays. In that pursuit, three major steps suggested are (i) strengthening the judicial system (ii) reducing the number of litigations and (iii) incorporating changes in IBC and other Statutes.
Strengthening the judicial system can be achieved by optimisation of workload. Currently, NCLTs handle matters pertaining to real estate companies and company law matters apart from IBC. Regarding real estate matters, the issues of home buyers in each case are different, complicated, and prone to numerous litigations; on the other hand, they demand quicker solutions as it affects the lives of innocent homebuyers.
At present, an exclusive regulator — Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), deals with the problems of homebuyers. It should be explored whether RERA could be merged with an exclusive bench in the tribunal to deal with all real estate matters.
In the Budget 2024, it is proposed that the company law matters will be handled by exclusive an bench. These two steps will enable other NCLT Benches to focus on IBC matters exclusively and reduce delays.
Secondly, a subordinate structure under the Adjudicating Authorities (AA) consisting of professionals with expertise in the field of law, administration and finance should be constituted to handle all administrative and procedural matters to support the AAs so that the precious time of AAs is spent only on “adjudication of legal disputes”. Necessary amendments are to be brought clearly defining the role, responsibilities and powers of the subordinate structure. This is like an expanded version of “Court Master” in High Courts.
Another key area that demands major change is the ‘preparation and carry forward of the daily cause list’. If for any reason a particular case mentioned in the daily cause list could not be taken up or completed on the same day, then they must be taken on the very next day as a priority. One must also ensure that no item listed in the Cause list is deferred by more than one week.
Fourthly, most of the litigation in tribunals, appellant tribunal and Supreme Court are initiated by promoters to scuttle the entire process. If promoters fail to file the audited financial statements with the Registrar of Companies (till the last financial year prior to the commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP)), to remit tax deducted at source and other statutory payments, they should not be allowed even to be a respondent to the initial applications filed under Section 7 of IBC. Nor should they be permitted to arrive at a settlement with the financial creditors under Section 12 A of IBC.
This single step would bring about a behavioural change among borrowers and reduce non- performing assets.
Besides, if directors, immediately after the initiation of CIRP, fail to handover the accounting records and systems, and statutory registers, they should not be permitted to participate in the meeting of Committee of Creditors, or submit their resolution plans. If these amendments are incorporated in IBC 2016, the number of litigations would drastically reduce as many promoters would be kept away from the resolution process. This will also improve statutory compliance by corporates.
Most often than not, promoters of companies initiate litigation immediately after the order initiating CIRP or liquidation of the corporate debtor to stay proceedings that frustrate the creditors. It is not uncommon that in many cases, the stay proceedings are not vacated for several months.
To combat this vexatious issue, it is recommended that any appeal against the order of CIRP or liquidation should get listed as a top priority item, either in the appellate tribunal or Supreme Court and be disposed of at the earliest.
No stone should be left unturned to have a robust IBC, where resolutions or recoveries are quicker. That alone will catapult India’s ambitious growth plans.

"VP asks KDEKS to boost Islamic finance innovation in Yogyakarta
""The digital infrastructure, which is already good, must be utilized to support the implementation of the digital-based halal industry MSME (micro, small, and medium enterprise) module,"" he said at the inauguration of Yogyakarta KDEKS here on Wednesday.
According to him, the digitalization of Islamic finance and social funds, such as the digitalization of Baitul Maal Wat Tamwil (a micro Islamic finance institution), will expand access and services as well as improve people's welfare.
He expressed optimism that the KDEKS will expedite efforts to optimize the potential of the Islamic economy and finance to make Yogyakarta a center of education, culture, creative economy, and tourism in Southeast Asia.
He appealed to the committee to oversee the integration of the Islamic economy and finance into the Regional Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPD) and the Regional Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) to ensure the harmony, continuity, and sustainability of programs.
""Yogyakarta KDEKS should be directly involved in the synchronization of policies at the central and regional levels to ensure the achievement of national development targets,"" Amin added.
The Vice President said he hopes that education and literacy on the Islamic economy and finance can be intensified more widely.
Deputy Governor of Yogyakarta, KGPAA Paku Alam X, said that the Islamic economy and finance are playing a strategic role in supporting MSMEs through fair and transparent financing.
In addition, the Islamic economy and finance are considered capable of improving access to capital, risk management, and support for business sustainability.
""Hopefully, the sharia model can be an important pillar in supporting MSME growth that is more equitable and sustainable,"" he said.

ATM Daniel Crosby Humans
Barry Ritholtz: Humans are a species of incredible innovation — in Art, Science, Literature. Yet of all the things we’re brilliant at investing isn’t one of them. Why? Well, we’re easily excited. We get focused on the wrong things, obsessed with what just happened rather than what might happen next. We’re bad at understanding maths, and we despise delaying gratification. Top all of this off with unjustified overconfidence, and you have a recipe for investing under-performance.
As it turns out, when it comes to investing, we’re just not built for it.
I’m Barry Ritholtz. And on today’s edition of at the money, we’re going to discuss how to become more systematic and rules based in managing our money to help us unpack all of this and what it means for your portfolio.
Let’s bring in Dr. Daniel Crosby. He’s the chief behavioral officer at Orion, where he develops tools, training, and technology, to help financial advisors apply behavioral science in their practice. He is also the author of the book, “The Laws of Wealth, Psychology and the Secret to Investing Success.”
So Daniel, let’s start with just a basic idea. Why is a rules-based approach to managing money so important?
Dr. Daniel Crosby: One reason is because rules work, you know, when we look at a meta-analysis, so this is a study of all the studies on how rules fair, simple rules, fair against a PhD level discretionary decision making, right?
Rules match or beat expert-level decision-making 94% of the time, which is pretty staggering. And we see this across contexts. We see this everywhere from medical diagnosis to stock picking to financial planning to prison recidivism studies. That one’s one of my favorite — they went from sort of having these soul-searching interviews with prisoners to looking at two variables, you know, what are they in for? And how did they act while they were in — and they increased the efficacy of their judgments by almost 400%.
They work is one reason and they’re cheap is another reason. It’s, it’s a lot cheaper to set up a checklist or a simple set of rules than to pay a bunch of CFAs to try and get it right. So they work and they work on a budget.
Barry Ritholtz: I love the idea of the checklist because it plays very much into an issue that’s a pet peeve of mine, which is investors tend to obsess about all these things they cannot control things that are out of their jurisdiction while ignoring the things that they can control. Talk a little bit about how creating a checklist allows you to focus on things that are within your control.
Daniel Crosby: When I wrote the book, you know, the very, the very first chapter, and I was intentional about the ordering. The very first chapter in the book is you control what matters most. Because I found what I think you find when you tell someone you work in markets that you work in finance, they ask you about a hundred things. All 100 are outside of their power: “What’s the Fed going to do? What’s the virus going to do? What’s the war going to do? Who’s going to win the election? Stuff that is almost inevitably unknowable and be outside of their power.
So what I think we have to encourage people to do is to take the power back — and to frame it that way because things like fees, things like diversification, choosing to work with a professional, all of these things are within our control and are far more predictive of you crossing your financial finish line than any of that other stuff.
Barry Ritholtz: There’s a great story in Michael Lewis’s book, um, about Sam FTX about Jane Street Trading. And even though they got the 2016 election results correct, they still were unable to anticipate what the market reaction would be. So not only are these things out of your control, and, and they are unknowable, but even when you know it, Hey, what’s the reaction of tens of millions of traders going to be? We really have no idea.
Daniel Crosby: It’s true. Like no one thought Trump would win. And then most folks who thought that he would win, thought that it would tank the market, uh, both things were proven wrong,
Barry Ritholtz: Really, really amazing. So, so let’s bring this back to the investing decision-making process. You emphasize why the process of making good decisions is so much more important than trying to predict market movements, explain.
Daniel Crosby: It’s really about being the house and not the degenerate gambler, right? If you look at all the bright lights in Vegas, all that gets paid for by tilting probability in favor of the house. And if you look at a lot of casino games, the edge the house has is not dramatic. I mean, in some cases it’s infinitesimally small, but tilting probability in your favor time and time and time again, showing up doing the things that are within your power time and time again, pays for some nice lights and some nice fountains as we see in Vegas. That’s all we’re trying to do here. Control the controllable tilt probability in our favor in a small way. You’re not always going to get it right, but you’re always going to be at the wheel.
Barry Ritholtz: I mentioned in the introduction that we’re all filled with so much overconfidence. You have a chapter titled, “You are not special.” Tell us about why investors need to stay humble and why we’re all subject to the same biases and errors as everybody else…
Daniel Crosby: I love this one because I think it demonstrates how psychological biases can serve us, uh, they, they serve us well in some domains in life. If we look at overconfidence bias, it serves us really nicely in some ways. People who exhibit it are happier. They’re more successful. They’re more likely to be successful entrepreneurs. God, they’re, they’re definitely more likely to run for office. There’s all of these things that that overconfidence does.
But when you apply it to markets, there’s, there’s three specific ways that we’re overconfident. The first is we think we’re better than average. Smarter, better, faster, stronger, better at picking stocks.
That’s the one that gets the most publicity, but there’s actually two others as well. One is we think we’re luckier than average. So you ask people, you know, what’s the likelihood of something happening to you, like getting divorced and like effectively no one says they’ll get divorced, even though, you know, one in two people gets divorced. No one thinks they’re going to get cancer or, you know, have diabetes or, you know, on and on and on. But if you ask people about their odds of finding love or winning the lottery, they, they dramatically overrate these probabilities. We sort of tend to own the optimistic and delegate the dangerous.
That’s a second sort of facet of overconfidence. And then the third one is we think that we’re more prescient about the future than we actually are. Like we think we’re better at forecasting what’s going to happen. So these three forms of overconfidence are a pretty toxic cocktail of bad decision making.
Our mutual friend, Jim O’Shaughnessy has this great line in his, his seminal work, “What Works on Wall Street” that I’ll butcher here, but it’s effectively like, look, rule one, step one. Is understanding that you are prone to all of the same screw ups as the next person. And until you’ve sort of deeply internalized that you, you shouldn’t start.
Barry Ritholtz: Jason Zweig asked Danny Kahneman what he does to avoid. all of the behavioral biases and heuristics that him and Amos Tversky discovered. And his answer was nothing. We can’t avoid it. They’re, they’re just totally unavoidable. Hey, if Danny Kahneman can’t avoid them, you know, what hope did the rest of us have?
There’s another, uh, line I really appreciate and, and this perhaps is because I began on a trading desk and what led me to realize it was time to move on was how much fun I was having regardless of my P& L. You write, “If it’s fun, you’re probably not making money.” I bet a lot of traders can confirm this. Tell us why fun and making money are not necessarily consistent and what we need to do to be more methodical and more disciplined.
Daniel Crosby: It’s really like one of these harsh truths about, I refer to it in the, in the book as Wall Street bizarro world, how the truths of every day are sort of one 80 to the truths of, of markets. And one of the things that we find is some of the most exciting, most fun ways to, to try and make money in the markets are the most deleterious to our wealth.
You look at day trading, the most comprehensive study on day trading ever done. was out of Taiwan, and they found that 1-in-360 day traders show evidence of skill. Is day trading fun? Like, absolutely. It’s a blast, right? Like making short-term trades can be fun. It can be intoxicating. It can be exciting. But the, the chances of you being good at it are vanishingly small.
You look at other stuff like IPO investing, you know, everyone’s got this story about if you’d put 10, 000 in Nvidia or Apple or whatever, you’d be a gazillionaire now. But we know that on average IPO does 21% worse than the S&P 500 in the first three years. And so again, is, is IPO investing fun? Yeah, absolutely. But you are the gambler. You are the gambler and not the house. And you’re unlikely to secure that Monet if you’re, if you’re engaging in these sorts of fun behaviors.
Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about forecasting is for weathermen. Why are we so bad at forecasting and what should we focus on?
Daniel Crosby: Well, it goes back to that. You know, it’s one of those primary forms of overconfidence and the research on this is just wild. You know, Philip Tetlock did sort of the seminal research on political and financial forecasting and found that even the experts are terrible at this. And in fact, the more famous an expert, the worse they tended to be. Because the way you get famous as a market prognosticator is making sort of a once in a lifetime black swan prediction. And then you tend to continue to bang that drum because it worked the first time and you know, history on average is pretty average and then you’re wrong.
But the reason we’re always going to look for this is the way that we’re wired, right? Our brains are 2 to 3% of our body weight, but they’re 20 to 25% of our caloric expenditures in a given day. And so when we look at people again, hooked up to an FMRI machine who are watching cable financial news, watching someone make predictions about what’s going to happen, the part of their brain associated with critical thinking and decision making actually goes to sleep which is candidly what we are looking for.
We’re looking for that peace of mind. We’re looking to think less and go into energy-saving mode. So as bad as we are at forecasting, there will always be a market for some sort of certainty. And I think the only thing that we can do is to work with a financial advisor who can give us some sort of certainty around our plan, our purpose, our immediate financial lives, instead of delegating that to some impersonal talking head.
Barry Ritholtz: So I’m glad you brought up the financial advisor. You discuss. how hard it is to do this alone and why you should seek professional advice and support, if for no other reason than to help you manage your biases and your emotions, discuss your experience with people working with professionals.
Daniel Crosby: This is, this is one of probably the two most powerful things you can do to manage those behavioral biases that Danny Kahneman talked about. He talks, as you said, about the futility of it. I think the two best hopes we have against behavioral bias is automation, and working with a professional.
The data is very clear now that people who work at the professional tend to do better than those that don’t. And when we look at a 2016 Merrill Lynch study. The things that an advisor does for you are all additive. They broke this down by the different things that an advisor does in his or her day. Everything from security selection to asset allocation to tax alpha, it all helps. But the thing that helps the most is again, this behavioral coaching, the emotion management, the guidance around decision-making keeping you from investing in your son-in-law’s dumb business, just these pivotal points along the way. That’s really where it adds about as 4 times as much value as the other stuff.
What’s cool for me as the son of a financial advisor who works with financial advisors every day is people who work with an advisor have better marital communications. They have higher levels of aggregate happiness.
They’re more prepared for an emergency. Like they have all these nonfinancial things in their life that get lifted because money touches everything we do. So if you can get that right, a lot of other boats in your life start to start to rise as well.
Barry Ritholtz: So to wrap up, humans are great at a lot of things. But we also come prepackaged with a lot of evolutionary baggage. We’re easily excitable. We make poor decisions. We think we’re special. We’re wildly over-optimistic, and we tend to overreact to every sign of trouble like it’s the end of the world.
We’re much better off if we have a rules-based systematic approach to managing risk and investing for the future rather than making these decisions on the fly. To help your portfolio, you really need to think about what is the best result for you over the long haul, not just making these decisions spur the moment.
I’m Barry Ritholtz. You’re listening to Bloomberg’s At The Money.

Billionaire Sells His Home For A 65% Discount. Is The Ultra Luxury Real Estate Market In Trouble?

Not every dream house has a dream outcome. Billionaire Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy has sold his Silicon Valley home at a deep discount to its original asking price. The San Francisco Standard reported that the five-bedroom mansion in Palo Alto, CA was sold for $35 million, nearly 65% below what he asked in 2018.
McNealy reportedly purchased the 13-acre lot in the 1980s but he and his wife Susan didn’t start building the home until 2008. McNealy founded Sun Microsystems in the 1980s which was later sold to Oracle for $7.4 billion. Over eight years, they spent nearly $11 million creating a highly customized stone and adobe structure. The house has over 21,000 square feet with every amenity a billionaire could desire, including an indoor ice rink, a gym with a climbing wall, a home theater, and a dance floor. Outside is a pool, spa, and large pavilion with views over the surrounding hillside.

The home first hit the market for $96.8 million in 2018. It was relisted for $53.9 million in January 2020 and removed from the market in 2022. The sale was handled off-market. Realtor Deepee Chattha, who had the listing in 2020, told the San Francisco Standard, “Whoever bought this property got a steal, even in the current economy.""
Real estate in Palo Alto, one of the most expensive cities in Silicon Valley, has continued to escalate in price. According to a June Redfin report, prices were up 15.6% year-over-year with a median price of $3.6 million. While sales were down 22%, homes did sell after just 14 days on the market. The area is still highly desirable and homes like the McNealy mansion are outliers because of their size and scale.

Positive And Negative Signs For High-End Homes
Homes at the ultrahigh end of the market usually take much longer to sell because the pool of buyers is much smaller and the homes are often highly customized to the owner. Kanye West recently found a buyer for his Malibu, CA beachside home after taking $14 million off the price tag. Realtor.com recently rounded up some high-profile homes in California that have seen major list price reductions. Casino mogul Steve Wynn has knocked $60 million off the price of his Beverly Hills home and still hasn't found a buyer. Rick and Kathy Hilton had to cut $30 million off the price of their Bel-Air mansion before it sold.
Not all of the data is negative and plenty of active, wealthy buyers remain. A recent report from Savills revealed that U.S. buyers are snapping up luxury real estate in Southern Europe. Real estate appraiser Miller Samuel and brokerage Douglas Elliman predict that 2024 will be a record breaker for extremely expensive homes. The U.S. has already had six home sales for $100 million or more this year including a New York City penthouse that sold for $115 million. A mansion in Palm Beach, FL sold for $152 million. ""It's a substantial uptick in the pace of sales, something we're not seeing at all in the broader housing market,"" said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel.
A Better Way To Profit From Real Estate?
The current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields. Private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities. Arrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.
Don't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.

"PF rerouted to beverage corp, local body funds used to pay discom dues
Hyderabad: Re-routing of funds from state’s institutional bodies, mortgaging government-owned properties for securing loans from banks, diversion of local body funds, matching grants under the centrally sponsored schemes and even tapping into employee PF savings — this is how the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was allegedly funding its ambitious welfare-oriented governance the past five years, often “bypassing regular budgetary processes and financial protocols.”
During the general elections, YSRCP chief and then CM Jagan had, in poll rallies across Andhra Pradesh, dwelt on his 58-month welfare track record of “having disbursed Rs 2.7 lakh crore in Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) and Rs 1.10 lakh crore through other welfare schemes.”
Nevertheless, in a crushing defeat, from 151 MLAs, the YSRCP was reduced to 11, with the TDP-led NDA bagging 164 of the 175 constituencies in the assembly polls held in May.
“I fail to comprehend these results, our debacle, despite having committedly implemented many welfare schemes like never before. I don’t know where the love, affection of the elderly etc beneficiaries has gone,” Jagan reacted on the results day, 4 June.
Apart from the social welfare pensions for the old, physically challenged and other needy, the YSRCP government was handing monetary aid under schemes such as Amma Vodi, YSR Aasara and YSR Cheyutha to benefit several sections like the poor mothers, financially disadvantaged women.
However, with no substantial growth, wealth generation to dip into, Jagan, according to the Chandrababu Naidu government and experts, laid his hands on various funds in every conceivable manner to meet the expenditure.
“In fact, increasingly higher proportions of borrowings were used for revenue expenditure, with no revenue streams generated to repay the debt, making the state further dependent on borrowings to repay the past loans. Lack of capital expenditure has affected the physical capital formation with a cascading impact on economic growth in the long run,” said the TDP government’s white paper on finances, a full version of which was accessed by ThePrint.
The paper says Jagan’s lopsided policies since 2019 — “gross neglect of capital expenditure, infrastructure like Polavaram, Amaravati, roads, and an anti-industrial policy (227 land allottees withdrawn, industries relocated to other states)” — resulted in a Rs 6.94 lakh crore loss in GSDP.
Under Jagan’s rule, the per capita income growth went down from 13.2 percent to 9.5 percent while per capita debt increased from Rs 74,790 to Rs.1,44,336. The white paper pegs the total revenue loss at Rs 76,195 crore.
CM Naidu made a PowerPoint presentation on “the dire situation of AP finances” in the assembly recently, based on the white paper.
The paper says that the Jagan government established the Andhra Pradesh State Financial Services (APSFS) as a non-banking financial company (NBFC) and the Andhra Pradesh State Development Corporation (APSDC) as another corporation to divert funds towards government expenditure, bypassing regular budgetary processes and financial protocols.
The fixed deposits and other funds of 33 different organisations, societies, and companies like AP Maritime Board, Streenidhi Credit Cooperative Federation Limited, NTR University of Health Sciences, etc. were deposited with APSFS, accumulating a total of Rs.4,738 crore. These inter-corporate deposits received by APSFS was Rs 3,669 crore in 2021-22, Rs 514.31 crore in 2022-23, Rs 553 crore in 2023-24, and Rs 1.50 crore in 2024-25.
The contribution from AP Maritime Board alone was Rs 1,200 crore; Streenidhi Credit Cooperative Federation Limited, which provides livelihood finance to SHG women, Rs 750 crore, AP Mineral Development Corporation Limited Rs 555 crore, NTR University of Health Sciences Rs 400 crore, Krishnapatnam Industrial City Development Limited Rs 300 crore, AP Building & Other Construction Workers Welfare Board Rs 240 crore, AP Board of Intermediate Education Rs 190 crore, and AP Industrial Development Corporation Limited Rs 145 crore, AP General Insurance Corporation Limited Rs 105 crore, and AP Pollution Control Board Rs 100 crore.
“This practice led to a significant reduction in the funds available for the intended work of these institutions, thereby weakening them. Further, the funds deposited with APSFS were loaned to APSDC. All the deposited funds and loans raised by APSFS were then utilised for government expenditure, violating best practices in financial management,” the paper says.
Apart from loans from APSFS, the APSDC borrowed Rs 23,200 crore as long-term loans from a consortium of banks. The borrowed money was also used allegedly to finance government expenditure i.e., welfare.
“In order to repay the loans of APSDC, the government levied the additional retail excise tax (ARET) as a fixed component at flat rate per bottle on the issue price of liquor sold by the AP State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL) from revenues of 10 APSBCL depots. The ARET revenue was escrowed for the repayment of loans taken by APSDC. This resulted in a total of Rs 14,275 crore being escrowed for APSDC loan repayment,” the paper says
Officials in the finance department, now functioning under Naidu, say the mismanagement extended to rerouting of funds from the state exchequer to the APSBCL.
“By reducing VAT rate and diverting a major share to APSBCL as a special margin, the government incurred a revenue loss of Rs 20,676 crore. APSBCL, in turn, showed this diverted revenue as their own and issued bonds based on it,” according to the white paper.
Moreover, it says that state-owned power utilities such as AP GENCO, AP TRANSCO, DISCOMs invested their pension and provident fund amounts in APSBCL bonds “at a lower interest rate.”
As on FY 2022-23, AP power utilities had outstanding government receivables (subsidy dues and department arrears) of Rs 23,572 crore.
Instead of paying these receivables and improve the institutional health, Jagan government made APGENCO and APTRANSCO invest Rs 2,134 crore and Rs 379 crore, respectively i.e., a total Rs 2,513 crore of Pension & Gratuity (P&G) Trust Funds and Provident Fund (PF) Trust Funds in the AP State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL) bonds.
“The PF, etc money was invested in the beverages corporation as per the then regime directions. An 8.5 percent interest was offered and the bonds were guaranteed by the government. The funds were used for welfare,” a senior official in the energy department told ThePrint.
Moreover, the Abhaya Hastham funds of Rs 2,100 crore, comprising savings of DWCRA (a self-help initiative) women, were also encashed, the white paper adds.

‘Higher taxes on citizens, financial strain on people’
Naidu, in the paper, grouses that funds raised through all these means were primarily used for regular government expenditure (the paper avoids use of word welfare) rather than for developmental projects or capital investments.
“Adding to these issues, APSBCL started supplying low-quality liquor and introduced unknown brands at significantly higher rates. As a result, there was an increase in black economy due to smuggling of Indian-made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) across border districts. These practices have caused irreparable damage to the excise revenue streams,” the paper says.
To compensate for “the financial mismanagement”, the Jagan government allegedly imposed higher taxes on citizens, further exacerbating the financial strain on the people.
“These measures collectively led to a total destruction of state finances, impacting the economic well-being of Andhra Pradesh. For instance, the repayment burden of loans taken by APSDC and APSBCL to finance DBT schemes would cost Rs 61,579 crore,” the paper says.
“This is tantamount to robbing the future generations and saddling them with debt without providing the corresponding benefits of improved infrastructure or capital development.”
Desperate to borrow more funds through APSDC, in addition to escrowing of ARET revenues, Jagan went on to mortgage government properties with a valuation of Rs 1,941 crore as security to lenders, the paper says listing 13 mortgaged properties including a polytechnic college, ITI, police quarters, offices of sericulture, a tehsildar in Vizag.
Moreover, the government has not transferred Rs 1,453 crore received in March from the central government to local bodies.
“Further, Rs 1,689 crore had accumulated in PD accounts of local bodies in the last five years. Thus, the government accumulated Rs 3,142 crore as liabilities to the local bodies. In addition, the AP DISCOMs were directly paid Rs 2,166 crore from local bodies’ funds towards pending electricity charges,” the paper says.
“The Jagan government was ill-advised, to say the least,” said a member of the state finance commission that recommends funds for local bodies.
According to Naidu, from 2019 when he vacated the CM’s chair, the Jagan government was always short of financial resources even to meet the essential expenditure.
“The untied revenue comprising state’s own revenue and tax devolutions were much lower than the essential expenditure requirement for salaries, pensions, debt servicing, welfare pensions, power subsidy, PDS subsidy, Arogyashree, Mid-day Meal scheme, anganwadi, and administrative expenditure. The gap between untied revenue and essential expenditure increased from Rs 32,891 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 59,995 crore in 2023-24. The previous government did not show any concern for the widening gap and pushed the state into a fiscal crisis,” the CM says in the paper, accusing his predecessor of “spending beyond means.”
As on 31 March 2019, the government debt was Rs 3,75,295 crore. By 12 June 2024, the debt burden and liabilities “reached an appalling level” of Rs. 9,74,556 crore. “The misadventures of the previous government have left unpaid dues to vendors and schemes to the tune of Rs 1,13,244 crore as reported by departments,” Naidu had stated in the House.
In the end, the Naidu government says, the much-hyped DBT programs of YSRCP government, purported to increase people’s wealth failed to produce desirous results while creating a logjam in the economy
“DBT expenditure led to higher public debt, burdening the future generations with repayment, and creating intergenerational inequity. The increase in taxes and inflation also added pressure on household incomes. The circular nature of government liabilities and circuitous manner of funding DBT schemes, not only had a deleterious impact on state finances, but also a cascading effect which has spread to different sectors, creating a logjam in the economy.
“While the government unabatedly continued revenue expenditure and borrowings, it did not have money to pay the piling bills, dues of DISCOMS, employees, etc. Misplaced priorities of the previous government have led to multiple complications, snowballing the financial crisis into an economic breakdown of the economy.”
I.Y.R.Krishna Rao, a retired IAS who had served as the AP chief secretary from 2014 to 2016 and now assocaited with BJP, says Jagan is fortunate to have lost the polls. “With no substantial revenue generation and the mounting financial mess, Jagan, if elected again, would have been forced to wind up or halt some of his much-touted welfare schemes, thereby losing his face.”
A former bureaucrat adds, “As his support was critical especially in the Rajya Sabha for passage of bills etc, the BJP led government at the centre, the last five years, turned a blind eye to Jagan’s financial indiscipline allowing him keep his vote bank happy.” .
Experts say some governments tend to make use of some “grey-areas”, the not so well defined aspects in the system to mobilise funds for their requirements.
“Though not illegal, the off-budget borrowings Jagan resorted to are not good for the economy. He seemed to have wanted to avoid the legislative scrutiny, as such funds are not accounted for in budget documents while also trying to show the fiscal deficit under limits,” says Ch Shankar Rao, associate professor in economics, Central University of Tamil Nadu.
‘Naidu did it too’
Former finance minister Buggana Rajendranath said there was no financial impropriety in resource mobilisation adopted by their government and that Naidu too had resorted to such practices during his tenure earlier.
“All the borrowings, including off-budget, were following the FRBM Act. And there is no secrecy as all the institutions like power utilities undergo regular audits. Even APSDC was formed, by enacting a legislation, to fund four welfare schemes Amma-vodi, Rythu Bharosa, Aasara and Cheyutha, providing livelihood, income generating opportunities to the poor,” Buggana told ThePrint.
The YSRCP leader said, in the concluding months of the earlier TDP government, “Naidu took about Rs 5,000 crore from the AP Civil Supplies Corporation to fund his Pasupu-Kunkuma scheme handing Rs 10,000 per women in SHGs just ahead of the 2019 polls.”
“How can it be right when you do it and wrong when we do the same? Moreover, we adopted some ways for funds as the state revenues were severely hit by Covid-19 pandemic for two years. Everything we did was in public notice and for public welfare,” he argued.

"Something's wrong with Andy Ogles' campaign finance reports
Columbia Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles has made over two dozen corrections to his campaign finance disclosures since his first run two years ago, and a review of his most recent disclosure shows his donations and spending still don’t add up.
From April 2022 to July 12, 2024, Ogles’ amended campaign finance reports show he raised around $2 million, while his expenses show he spent around $1.4 million, a Lookout analysis of his campaign finance records shows.
Ogles should have around $600,000 in cash available. His disclosure shows he has just over $300,000 in cash in his campaign account, leaving another $300,000 unaccounted for.
The discrepancy between cash on hand and reported expenses has been an issue for Ogles since he launched his candidacy in April 2022.
The Federal Election Commission sent Ogles three letters a month ago regarding this mismatch.
This discrepancy could be a reason FBI agents executed a search warrant on Ogles last week, following his victory in a Republican primary to retain his Middle Tennessee U.S. House seat.
After NewsChannel 5 reported on the search warrant, the congressman took to Twitter to say they had seized his phone.
Federal election officials threaten Ogles with campaign finance audit or enforcement – again
“It has been widely reported for months that my campaign made mistakes in our initial financial filings,” Ogles said in a post on X. “We have worked diligently with attorneys and reporting experts to correct the errors and ensure compliance going forward.
“Last Friday, the FBI took possession of my cell phone. It is my understanding that they are investigating the same well-known facts surrounding these filings. I will of course fully cooperate with them, just as I have with the Federal Election Commission. I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes and nothing more.”
The Lookout reached out to Ogles’ office and had not received a response by the time of publication.
When Ogles started his campaign, he misled the public by stating in a news release that he raised around $450,000 without loaning his campaign any money. In reality, Ogles raised around $250,000 and claimed to loan his campaign $320,000.
He then amended two years of campaign finance reports earlier this year, stating that he had only loaned $20,000 to his campaign.
Ogles said in a May news release that the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife. He claimed he only learned after the fact that this wasn’t allowed and said his campaign never used the cash.
Ogles’ actions drew a complaint from the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan government watchdog. On top of campaign disclosure issues, the group said Ogles also failed to disclose a $700,000 line of credit he opened following his primary win in 2022.
The organization compared Ogles to former New York Republican U.S. Rep. George Santos, who, among many charges, is alleged to have falsely claimed he loaned $500,000 to his campaign in an attempt to pay himself from donations.
Ogles’ loan also helped him during the crucial early phases of his 2022 campaign, when he faced a crowded primary field that included former Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell.
He went on to win the primary and defeat Nashville Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell in the Republican-titled seat.
Metro Council member Courtney Johnston challenged Ogles in the primary this year. She tried to attack him over these financial discrepancies and other ethical concerns. But Ogles handily defeated her and is favored to win the seat in the November general election when he faces Democrat Maryam Abolfazli.

"Western allies condemn Israeli finance minister’s suggestion that starving Gaza might be justified
Israel’s Western allies have condemned remarks by the country’s far-right finance minister who suggested that the starvation of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians “might be just and moral” until hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel are returned home.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in a speech on Monday that Israel had no choice but to send humanitarian aid into Gaza.
“It’s not possible in today’s global reality to manage a war – no one will allow us to starve 2 million people, even though that might be just and moral until they return the hostages,” he said at a conference in support of Jewish settlements.
Smotrich, a key partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition, supports the reoccupation of Gaza, the rebuilding of Jewish settlements that were removed in 2005, and what he describes as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians out of the territory.
The European Union on Wednesday condemned his remarks, noting that the “deliberate starvation of civilians is a war crime.”
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called the remarks “beyond ignominious,” saying “it demonstrates, once again, his contempt for international law and for basic principles of humanity.”
David Lammy, Britain’s new foreign secretary, said “there can be no justification for Minister Smotrich’s remarks.”
“We expect the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them,” he wrote on the social media platform X.
Germany’s ambassador to Israel, Steffen Siebert, called the remarks “unacceptable and appalling.”
“It is a principle of international law and of humanity to protect civilians in a war and to give them access to water and food,” he wrote on X.
Egypt’s foreign ministry on Thursday also condemned Smotrich’s remarks, describing them as “shameful statements unacceptable in form and substance” and a violation of international humanitarian law. Such “irresponsible statements” create incitement against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the ministry added.
The ongoing war sparked by Hamas’ attack has plunged Gaza into a humanitarian catastrophe. The vast majority of its population has been displaced within the blockaded territory, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. The leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, said in June that Gaza was at “high risk” of famine.
Aid organizations say efforts to deliver food and other assistance have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. Israel says it allows unlimited humanitarian aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for failing to promptly deliver it.
Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in the surprise attack into Israel that triggered the war and took around 250 hostages. Some 110 hostages are still being held in Gaza, though Israel believes that about a third of them are dead. Most of the rest were released during a week-long November ceasefire.
Israel’s continuing offensive has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and has caused widespread devastation."

Hi Judy, can you tell us your favourite places in London where you can get a meal for two for less than £40?
Since 1900, Paul Rothe & Son in Marylebone has been crafting some of the best sandwiches in London. Lucky for me, I live just around the corner from this charming, historic deli.
My go-to is their famous pastrami and cheese, piled high with pickle, mayo, and mustard. Occasionally, I'll switch things up with their epic coronation chicken, or if I'm feeling adventurous, a jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn. It's quintessentially British, and I love it.
Trejo's Tacos has crossed the pond, opening its first international outpost in Notting Hill. Founded by actor Danny Trejo, this canteen boasts a cult following in Los Angeles (myself included) and has quickly become my favourite spot for tacos in London.
My usual order includes a plate of Baja fish and spicy shrimp tacos, dosed in their house hot sauce and perfectly complemented by one of their stellar OG margaritas or homemade horchata. I also love their house-made guacamole and salsa served with their truly addictive freshly fried corn tortilla chips. I just munch away while thinking of the southern California sun.
I live near Edgware Road, an area renowned for its vibrant Middle Eastern community and fantastic cuisine. Maroush, a London institution with multiple venues across the city, remains a favourite, especially the original one on Edgware Road.
The chicken or lamb shawarma is the star dish, slow-cooked on vertical rotisseries, infused with aromatic spices, and expertly sliced off with sabers. It's the perfect late-night snack after a few too many pints. I love their tomato okra stew with rice - so comforting and warming.
Tucked away in the basement of an unassuming British pub down a quaint mews street in Marylebone is Liu Xiaomian.
I usually order the minced pork xiaomian - toothsome wheat noodles swimming in a red chilli broth, then dressed with seasoned pork and fragrant spring onions.

"Why Jay Powell refuses to be bullied by Wall Street
A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.
Finance Bro Summer is officially winding down. The sun rises later and sets earlier on the streets of FiDi, and the TikTokers looking for a man in finance (trust fund, six-five, blue eyes) have moved on to pommel horse nerds and Tim Walz’s big dad energy.
It’s perhaps fitting, then, that Wall Street’s fleeting moment in the meme zeitgeist comes to a close just as the investing crowd is getting thoroughly put in its place by Certified Nerdy Dad and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Hayden Powell.
Here’s the deal: On Monday, as global stock market turmoil spilled over into the US, investors were crying out for the central bank to do something drastic, something it hasn’t done since the start of the pandemic in 2020 — call an emergency meeting to slash interest rates and stanch the bleeding on Wall Street.
Powell’s response was a classic dad move: Ignore the screaming toddler and let the tantrum run its course.
The whole episode underscored a fundamental tension between the Fed, which is focused on economic stability, and Wall Street, which is focused on profit.
The two institutions need each other. They’re part of a big family that keeps commerce flowing in the world’s largest economy. And, like most families, they rarely agree on what to do, and they sometimes hate each other.
Stock traders and analysts aren’t shy about complaining when the Fed isn’t moving on their preferred timeline. The Fed, for its part, stays largely out of the muck of name-calling. But Powell, in particular, has a knack for the sarcastic retort.
Last week, he told reporters (more or less) that the pundits can shout all they want on CNBC and it won’t matter one lick to the grown-ups making policy at the Fed.
“We follow the many commentators who bless us with their commentary,” he said. “But we don’t change anything in our approach.” (That’s what counts as a scathing critique in Powell’s buttoned-up briefing room.)
The message from Powell and other policymakers is clear: We won’t be strong-armed by Wall Street. It’s not surprising coming from Powell, an avowed Paul Volcker fanboy who has praised the former Fed boss’s unflinching approach to fighting inflation (even when it meant triggering two recessions).
Powell’s stance is a stark contrast with the scene playing out in Japan. In short: The Japanese central bank last week raised interest rates for only the second time in 17 years, and its top policy official rattled investors by hinting at more to come.
A week and one giant stock market correction later, the Bank of Japan sent out another official to walk back those comments and try to calm investors.
The BOJ’s deputy governor, Shinichi Uchida, citing volatility in financial markets, said the bank would not raise its policy interest rate as long as markets remain unstable.
And just like that, Japanese stocks surged.
Parents of all stripes know the hazards of rewarding bad behavior. In the BOJ’s case, Uchida’s comments illustrate a problem central banks have found themselves in for the past two decades, according to economist Mohamed El-Erian.
Writing for Bloomberg on Wednesday, he wrote that central banks have repeatedly “attempted to take the difficult but necessary steps to deal with economic and financial imbalances, only to fold under market pressure … The pause that the BoJ felt forced to adopt is likely to eventually conflict with the country’s economic well-being,” El-Erian says.
Powell (formerly in finance, hazel eyes, great ties) appears to have a real opportunity to Volcker it up even more in the coming weeks.
Markets have rebounded, quieting calls for an emergency rate cut, and Powell isn’t due to speak publicly until his (always closely watched) address at the Jackson Hole summit, which starts August 22.
That gives Wall Street plenty of time to sit in the corner and deal with its feelings."
"31% annual jump in homeowner repossessions in second quarter of 2024
The number of homes being repossessed jumped in the second quarter of this year, according to figures from lenders.
Some 980 homeowner mortgaged properties were repossessed in the second quarter of 2024, marking an 8% increase compared with the previous quarter and a 31% rise compared with the same quarter in 2023.
And 710 buy-to-let (BTL) mortgaged properties were also repossessed, which was 13% higher than in the previous quarter and a 51% annual jump, according to data from UK Finance, which represents the banking and finance industry.
UK Finance said the rise in repossessions of mortgaged properties is largely due to the courts working through historic arrears cases.
Repossessions remain very low compared with historic norms, it said.
If you are worried about your finances, please reach out to your lender as soon as possible
Charles Roe, UK Finance
The total number of homeowner and BTL repossessions in the second quarter of 2024 was 15% lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, just before the coronavirus pandemic struck, and 87% lower than the first quarter of 2009, when repossessions peaked during the financial crisis.
Lenders will always seek to ensure customers remain in their homes and repossession is only ever a last resort after other options have been explored, UK Finance added.
Many lenders have signed up to a mortgage charter, offering a range of tailored options for struggling borrowers.
UK Finance said that the number of homeowner mortgages in arrears was broadly unchanged throughout the second quarter if 2024 compared with the previous quarter, with a 0.5% decrease.
There were 96,070 homeowner mortgages in arrears of 2.5% or more of the outstanding balance in the second quarter of 2024.

The number of BTL mortgages in arrears increased by 1% compared with the previous quarter, reaching 13,570.
The overall proportion of mortgages in arrears remains low, at 1.10% of homeowner mortgages and 0.69% of BTL mortgages, UK Finance said.
It added that the number of borrowers getting into early mortgage arrears has fallen, suggesting there will be a limited increase in arrears cases in the next quarter.
However, the decrease also partly reflects some customers who were previously in early arrears moving into more serious shortfalls, it added.
The Bank of England base rate was cut from 5.25% to 5% last week and mortgage lenders have been cutting some rates in recent weeks, easing some of the strain on borrowers.
However borrowers coming off mortgage rates which were fixed several years ago onto a new deal could still face a payment shock.
Charles Roe, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said: “The number of mortgages in arrears has remained broadly flat compared to the previous quarter, which is good news following recent increases.
“This reflects the fact that while many households remain under pressure, the challenges of higher rates and the cost of living have begun to ease.
“However, we know that this will not be the case across all households, and lenders want to support anyone who might be struggling.
“Lenders offer a range of support to anyone worried about their finances.
“If you are worried about your finances, please reach out to your lender as soon as possible to discuss the support options available.
“Doing so won’t affect your credit score.”"
"The Worst Man in Israel Makes a 'Moral' Argument for Genocide | Opinion
Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, is as contemptible as they come. He also may well be the most dangerous member, by far, of Israel's far right government. He proved this conclusively yet again earlier this week when he condoned the hypothetical mass starvation of millions of Palestinian civilians. I'm not making this up.
Smotrich threw down this particular putrid gauntlet on the heels of Vice President Kamala Harris remarks, following her meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, in which she expressed compassion for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza while condemning Hamas as ""a brutal terrorist organization"" and reiterating her and the Biden administration's unequivocal support of Israel's right to defend itself against its enemies.
The part of Harris' statement that triggered Smotrich's latest outrage must have been her determination, shared by anyone with even a shred of humanitarian compassion, that she would ""not be silent"" in the face of ""what has happened in Gaza over the past nine months . . . the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.""
Speaking at a conference in Israel earlier this week, Smotrich said that Israel was providing humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza ""because there is no choice,"" and declared that while starving two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza to death ""might be justified and moral,"" the international community would prevent this from happening.
Smotrich's exact words, lest anyone think I might be exaggerating: ""Nobody will let us cause two million civilians to die of hunger, even though it might be justified and moral, until our hostages are returned.""
In other words, he would have no problem perpetrating and justifying a genocide, if only the world would let him get away with it.
Genocide? That's precisely what this paragon is saying. According to the 1948 United Nations Convention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, genocide is defined as any of a number of specified acts ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.""
Does anyone in their right mind doubt that the horror that Smotrich is contemplating would fit four-square into that definition?
Let's remember that the killing of some four million Ukrainians by Stalin's Soviet Union in the Holodomor, or Great Famine, of 1932-1933 has been recognized as a genocide by both houses of the U.S. Congress, as well as a wide array of U.N. member states, as well as the Vatican.
And Smotrich was reckless enough to make this utterance at the very time that Israel is being accused of genocide before the International Court of Justice.
The genocide charge brought by South Africa against Israel at the ICJ is deficient as a matter of law since Israel's ""intent"" in its war against Hamas in Gaza was never ""to destroy, in whole or in part,"" the Palestinians there. Rather, Israel's wholly legitimate goal was and is to eliminate that terrorist organization as an existential threat, bearing in mind that pursuant to its own 1988 Covenant, it is Hamas that is dedicated to the genocidal elimination of Jews living anywhere between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.
Still, what Smotrich accomplished with his declaration was to point out that while Israel's government envisages the permanent presence of the Palestinian population in Gaza after the end of the current war against Hamas, there is at least one senior member of that government who would countenance that population's destruction. This is a gift to Israel's many enemies and to other antisemites worldwide.
To their credit, the American Jewish Committee and the ADL have denounced Smotrich's comments in no uncertain terms, as have the U.S. State Department, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, and J Street.
A virulent racist who makes no secret of his hatred for all Arabs and Palestinians, Smotrich epitomizes the ugliest aspects of what is the most extremist government in the State of Israel's 76-year history.
Uglier than Netanyahu who repeatedly lies through his teeth, even to President Joe Biden, about his willingness to make a deal to free the hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza for almost 10 months? Uglier than the buffoonish neo-fascist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir who has publicly insulted Biden repeatedly despite the fact that it is the Biden administration that not only has had Israel's back since the Oct. 7 Hamas pogrom but has provided it with literally billions of dollars in military aid and equipment? Uglier than Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli who disparages and denigrates non-orthodox Jews—in particular Reform Jews—and members of the LGBTQ community at every opportunity? Uglier than Justice Minister Yariv Levin who makes no secret of his desire to scuttle Israel's independent judiciary in the sycophantic service of his criminally indicted boss?
Yes, yes, yes, and yes.
Throughout his political career, Smotrich has espoused bigoted views that belie his professed self-identification as an observant Jew. To highlight one appalling example, in 2016, while a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, representing the religious Zionist Jewish Home Party, he advocated separating Jewish and Arab women in maternity wards. ""Arabs are my enemies and that's why I don't enjoy being next to them,"" he explained on that occasion, causing future prime minister Naftali Bennett, then the head of the Jewish Home Party and minister of education, to remind him that as a matter of Jewish religious law, ""every human created in God's image is favored."" That meant, Bennett added, ""every human, Jewish or Arab.""
It was also Smotrich who told Israel Army Radio in December 2023 that he was in favor of the mass emigration (ouster?) of most Palestinians from Gaza. ""If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not 2 million Arabs,"" he said, ""the entire discussion on the day after will be totally different.""
In March of 2023, after militant Jewish settlers rampaged through the West Bank town of Huwara in retaliation for the fatal shooting of two Israeli brothers by a Palestinian terrorist from that town, Smotrich backed the rioters' violence that had left one Palestinian dead and several wounded and said that Huwara ""needs to be wiped out,"" an utterance so extreme even for him that he found it necessary (perhaps with the proverbial gun to his head) to apologize for it.
Smotrich has unreserved contempt for Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. ""Arabs are citizens of Israel, for now at least, and they have representatives at the Knesset, for now at least,"" he proclaimed on one occasion, calling into question, at least as far as he was concerned, the civil and political rights Israeli Arabs have enjoyed since the establishment of the state.
As regards the Palestinians, he contemptuously denies their national identity. ""There is no such thing as Palestinians because there's no such thing as the Palestinian people,"" he declared at an event in Paris in March of this year. ""The Palestinian people are an invention of fewer than 100 years ago. Do they have a history, a culture? No, they don't. There are no Palestinians. There are just Arabs.""
Not surprisingly, therefore, he has long been an inflexible opponent of Palestinian statehood in any shape or form and instead wants Israel to formally annex the West Bank and dramatically expand Jewish settlements there, a priori impediments to any viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It would be convenient to dismiss Smotrich as an outlier who does not represent the vast majority of mainstream Israelis who despise him, except that he isn't. He and the aforementioned Ben-Gvir hold the balance of power in Netanyahu's government and could bring it crashing down at any moment.
Netanyahu, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir all aspire to emasculate if not totally eradicate Israel's democratic character and impose a top down quasi-totalitarianism bereft of checks and balances, in particular an independent judiciary that safeguards individual rights. However, while Netanyahu is widely regarded as the ultimate opportunist whose sole goal is to have absolute power, or as close to absolute as he can get, and to exercise it at will, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are true believers—modern day fascisti, as it were—who fit in nicely with many of the ultranationalist and xenophobic groups that are sprouting up across the globe.
In addition, Smotrich brings another noxious ingredient to the mix. He is a religious zealot who holds a simultaneously messianic and apocalyptic view of Jewish history—Nehemiah Shtraser of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has called him a ""a disciple of Jewish race theory"" and ""a denier of science, equality and progress."" In his myopic worldview, ""historical truth"" and ""biblical truth"" are one and the same. To give just one example of his antediluvian mindset, he believes that ""God created the world in six days. The theory of evolution is passé . . . It's delusional to think we came from monkeys."" Take that, Charles Darvin.
Such an approach has ominous implications. It certainly should not be lost on anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of Jewish history that zealots and zealotry were key if unwitting allies of the Babylonians and Romans in destroying the Jewish commonwealths of biblical and post-biblical times.
According to recent reports, the Biden administration considered sanctioning Smotrich because of his refusal to convey hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority and for his role in blocking enforcement against illegal Jewish settlement construction on the West Bank but ultimately decided not to do so.
In light of Smotrich's latest vile utterances condoning a hypothetical genocide, perhaps sanctioning him should be put back on the table.

TV chef picks best cheap eats in London
Every Wednesday we ask top chefs to pick their favourite Cheap Eats where they live and when they cook at home. This week we speak to TV chef Judy Joo, who co-owns the popular Seoul Bird in London.
Hi Judy, can you tell us your favourite places in London where you can get a meal for two for less than £40?
Since 1900, Paul Rothe & Son in Marylebone has been crafting some of the best sandwiches in London. Lucky for me, I live just around the corner from this charming, historic deli.
My go-to is their famous pastrami and cheese, piled high with pickle, mayo, and mustard. Occasionally, I'll switch things up with their epic coronation chicken, or if I'm feeling adventurous, a jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn. It's quintessentially British, and I love it.
Trejo's Tacos has crossed the pond, opening its first international outpost in Notting Hill. Founded by actor Danny Trejo, this canteen boasts a cult following in Los Angeles (myself included) and has quickly become my favourite spot for tacos in London.
My usual order includes a plate of Baja fish and spicy shrimp tacos, dosed in their house hot sauce and perfectly complemented by one of their stellar OG margaritas or homemade horchata. I also love their house-made guacamole and salsa served with their truly addictive freshly fried corn tortilla chips. I just munch away while thinking of the southern California sun.
I live near Edgware Road, an area renowned for its vibrant Middle Eastern community and fantastic cuisine. Maroush, a London institution with multiple venues across the city, remains a favourite, especially the original one on Edgware Road.
The chicken or lamb shawarma is the star dish, slow-cooked on vertical rotisseries, infused with aromatic spices, and expertly sliced off with sabers. It's the perfect late-night snack after a few too many pints. I love their tomato okra stew with rice - so comforting and warming.
Tucked away in the basement of an unassuming British pub down a quaint mews street in Marylebone is Liu Xiaomian.
I usually order the minced pork xiaomian - toothsome wheat noodles swimming in a red chilli broth, then dressed with seasoned pork and fragrant spring onions. The numbing pork wontons are another standout, delivering what their name promises in true mala style. Don't miss the cucumber side salad which offers a refreshing respite for your palate.
What is your go-to cheap eat to cook at home when you have a night in?
My go-to budget-friendly meal for cooking at home is pimped-out instant ramen noodles.
If I am feeling spicy, I'll grab a pack of Shin Ramen and add fresh veggies and leftover proteins from the fridge.
Spinach, mushrooms, corn, spring onions, leftover roasted chicken, and some frozen dumplings usually make their way into the pot. Absolutely anything goes!
And, to finish, I'll crack an egg in and let it cook on top of the noodles just until the yolk is set, but still gooey. It's a quick, delicious meal that hits the spot every time.

"Procura por mestrados disparou mas propinas até 20 mil euros impedem alunos de prosseguir estudos
A procura por mestrados disparou nas últimas duas décadas, passando de dois mil para 32 mil, mas as propinas de alguns cursos impedem muitos de prosseguir os estudos, alerta um especialista em economia de educação.
Há mestrados que custam mais de 15 mil euros e até quase 20 mil, mas também há outros com propinas exatamente iguais aos valores das licenciaturas (menos de 700 euros anuais).
As instituições de ensino superior têm autonomia para definir os valores e quem manda é o mercado, baseando-se “na procura e no estatuto da instituição”, explica o especialista em economia de educação, Belmiro Gil Cabrito.
A procura começou a aumentar há duas décadas, com a Declaração de Bolonha, que veio tornar comparáveis os diferentes sistemas de ensino superior europeu. As licenciaturas passaram de cinco para três anos.
“Houve uma degradação e diminuição do valor do mercado da licenciatura”, sublinhou o professor associado do Instituto de Educação, da Universidade de Lisboa, baseando-se em estudos realizados em França.
A realidade portuguesa mostra que, até então, a aposta das famílias era conseguir que os filhos tirassem uma licenciatura, havendo “poucos mestres”. No ano em que foi assinada a Declaração de Bolonha, em 1999, formaram-se em Portugal menos de dois mil mestres e cerca de 30 mil alunos terminaram a sua licenciatura, segundo dados da Direção-Geral de Estatísticas de Educação e Ciência (DGEEC).
Em apenas 10 anos, o número de novos diplomados cresceu quase 10 vezes, continuando a ser distante o número de licenciados e mestrados. Em 2023, a diferença estava já muito mais esbatida: Cerca de 56 mil terminaram uma licenciatura e outros 33 mil o mestrado.
Apesar do aumento, “a acessibilidade aos mestrados não é igual para todos”, alerta o professor aposentado. Se as instituições ligadas às humanidades optam por valores mais próximos da propina mínima, alguns cursos científicos apresentam “mestrados com propinas pela hora da morte”.
O defensor da universalidade e gratuitidade da Educação lamenta que as Instituições de Ensino Superior (IES) usem a forma como o “mercado olha para os cursos” para definir os valores a pagar pelos alunos, tornando-os no ‘elo mais fraco'”.
“Há uma construção de estatuto social que se vai construindo. Há cursos que são percecionados como sendo muito bons e com muita saída profissional. Aparecem num ‘ranking’ internacional e têm professores mais reconhecidos. Mas há professores realmente bons em todas as instituições”, diz Belmiro Gil Cabrito.
Os cursos mais apelativos são os das áreas das engenharias e de gestão, destacando-se os da Faculdade de Economia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Nova SBE), do ISCTE ou do ISEG.
O “mestrado regular com CEMS MIM”, da Nova SBE, por exemplo, custa 19.650 euros. É um programa “na vanguarda da oferta de mestrados”, lê-se no ‘site’ da instituição, que explica que no 1.º ano os alunos seguem o currículo do mestrado de Gestão e no 2.º ano combinam “temas transversais, cursos, seminários e projetos desenvolvidos” pelas 34 escolas de negócios da Aliança.
Em troca de quase 20 mil euros, estes alunos podem estudar um semestre na Nova SBE e outro numa das 33 melhores escolas de Gestão do mundo.
Há outro mestrado de Gestão da Nova SBE com “double degrees”, que custa 16 mil euros e também prevê que parte da formação seja feita numa instituição parceira.
A escola garante estar “consciente das dificuldades de algumas famílias para fazer face a este investimento” e por isso atribui anualmente bolsas de estudo, tendo “satisfeito 100% dos pedidos elegíveis de apoio financeiro” no ano passado, refere o gabinete de imprensa em declarações enviadas à Lusa.
O professor Belmiro Gil Cabrito sublinha que muitas vezes não é suficiente: “Tem aumentado o valor das bolsas em número e em dinheiro, mas quando um dos pais está desempregado ou quando os dois ganham o salário mínimo já fazem grande ginástica para chegar ao fim do mês. Tenho sérias duvidas que não haja desistências por incapacidade financeira. Se isso acontece com as licenciaturas, muito mais acontece nos mestrados”.
O especialista lamenta que o preço de alguns mestrados impacte em muitos candidatos que “certamente gostariam de continuar a estudar, mas não podem”.
O mestrado em Gestão do ISCTE foi desenhado para “dar continuidade à formação de 1.º ciclo em Gestão”, mas a propina é de 7.350 euros. Também no ISCTE Business School, são precisos 5.800 euros para o mestrado em Métodos Analíticos para a Gestão, e 6.850 euros para o curso de Contabilidade e Controlo de Gestão.
Ali perto, no ISEG, também há cursos que custam, pelo menos, sete mil euros: As propinas do mestrado em Finance são 7.900 euros, as de Management são 7.800 euros e as de Ciências Empresariais são sete mil euros.
“Existem propinas bem diferenciadas para a mesma coisa”, alerta o investigador, lembrando que neste campeonato também conta o “estatuto que a instituição tem de si”.
A Universidade do Porto (UP), que tem as médias de acesso mais altas do país para as licenciaturas de Gestão e Economia, apresenta por outro lado propinas de mestrados muito mais baixas.
O acesso aos quatro mestrados de continuidade “dirigidos a recém-licenciados” da Faculdade de Economia custam 1.500 euros, assim como os mestrados de Especialização dirigidos a quem quer “reforçar as suas competências nas áreas específicas dos cursos para potenciar as suas carreiras”.
No entanto, os “mestrados executivos” da Faculdade de Economia da UP já se aproximam dos sete mil euros.
No Instituto Politécnico de Tomar, por exemplo, os 18 meses de mestrado em Gestão custam 2.100 euros e no Politécnico de Santarém as propinas para o mesmo mestrado são de mil euros por ano.
Dentro da mesma instituição, as propinas variam consoante a formação oferecida: No Politécnico de Santarém, os mestrados na área da Enfermagem Comunitária custam 1.500 euros por ano, enquanto o mestrado de Enfermagem de Saúde Materna e Obstétrica tem um valor de dois mil euros anual.
Em algumas áreas, como Medicina ou Arquitetura, é exigido o mestrado para se poder exercer a profissão. Nestes casos, são mestrados integrados com propinas iguais às das licenciaturas.
“Apesar do esforço que o Estado faz com residências – que continuam a ser poucas, mas isso não significa que não gaste milhões – com refeições, oferecendo preços de cantina verdadeiramente inferiores ao custo real da comida, e com bolsas, ainda há muitos que ficam para trás”, lamentou.
Para o especialista, um dos grandes problemas associados aos valores dos mestrados está relacionado “com a desresponsabilização do Estado” que, nos últimos anos, tem deixado que as instituições sobrevivam sozinhas.
Em 1995, 95% do orçamento das IES provinha do Orçamento do Estado e apenas os restantes 5% advinham de propinas, doações ou projetos de investigação.
Atualmente, as IES têm de cobrir mais de 40% do seu orçamento, diz o especialista. “Onde vão buscar o dinheiro? Às propinas”, observa, explicando que, no geral, só as propinas do 1.º e 2.º ciclos rondam entre os 16% e os 17% do orçamento das IES.
“Vão buscar o dinheiro aos alunos e se puderem cobrar mais, cobram mais. A parte mais fraca são os alunos”, lamenta.
Resultado: “Entre possíveis futuros mestres, muitos não o são por incapacidade financeira e estes acabam por ser penalizados depois também no mercado de trabalho, com empregos mais precários”, critica.
Belmiro Gil Cabrito lembra que perante dois candidatos, em que um tem uma licenciatura e outro tem um mestrado, “é natural que o empregador prefira, para a mesma função e a pagar o mesmo, ter um mestre em vez de um licenciado”."
"Brasil tem 4ª maior nota em ranking do IIF sobre transparência de dívida em emergentes
O Brasil obteve a quarta melhor nota entre 50 países emergentes avaliados pelo Institute of International Finance (IIF), que divulgou neste mês de julho o Relatório de Relacionamento com Investidores e Transparência de Dívida 2024 (IIF Investor Relations and Debt Transparency Report). A informação foi divulgada nesta quinta-feira, 18, pelo Ministério da Fazenda.
De acordo com a pasta, o IIF destacou que a Gerência de Relacionamento Institucional (GERIN) da Coordenação-Geral de Planejamento Estratégico da Dívida Pública (COGEP) atendeu a 94% das melhores práticas de transparência e a 70% de todos os critérios de avaliação.
A Fazenda explicou que, desde 2005, o IIF publica a pontuação da área de relacionamento com investidores de países emergentes, baseada em um conjunto de melhores práticas. O Brasil participa desta avaliação desde o seu início e, nos últimos anos, tem se mantido entre os países mais bem avaliados no índice geral (country score), disse o Ministério. A partir de 2022, o IIF passou a incluir uma avaliação específica quanto a aspectos ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance). Na avaliação de 2024 (referente a 2023) o Brasil aumentou sua nota em 30% nesse critério.
Para a equipe econômica, o resultado reflete o crescente compromisso do País em acompanhar e implementar políticas sustentáveis, traduzido nos marcos da publicação do Arcabouço Brasileiro para Títulos Soberanos Sustentáveis em setembro de 2023 e da emissão inaugural de títulos soberanos sustentáveis em novembro de 2023, ações do eixo de Finanças Sustentáveis do Plano de Transformação Ecológica.
“Em 2024, o Brasil realizou sua segunda emissão soberana sustentável e divulgará o primeiro relatório de alocação e impacto, o que fortalece o avanço dessa agenda e contribui com a obtenção de resultados cada vez mais aderentes às melhores práticas internacionais. O desempenho do Tesouro Nacional evidencia o contínuo e crescente compromisso da instituição com o aperfeiçoamento e transparência das informações divulgadas, bem como com a comunicação com o público e com a agenda de sustentabilidade”, disse a pasta."
"Sistema financeiro do futuro será mais ""humanizado""
Implementado há três anos, o Open Finance representa uma grande evolução no sistema financeiro brasileiro. Segundo dados da Federação Brasileira de Bancos (Febraban), a iniciativa contou com investimentos de R$ 2 bilhões das instituições financeiras. O resultado vem sendo uma forte adoção: entre janeiro de 2023 e de 2024, o número de consentimentos saltou 100%, para 42 milhões de pessoas. Atualmente, mais de 1 bilhão de comunicações bem-sucedidas ocorrem semanalmente, tornando o Open Finance brasileiro o maior do mundo, tanto em número de acessos quanto na amplitude de serviços englobados. O amplo roadmap de evolução reitera o grau de maturidade e inovação do Brasil neste setor que, segundo a futurista Amy Webb, está no epicentro da transformação digital e é vital para a economia do país.
No último ano, os clientes passaram a poder permitir o compartilhamento de dados dos produtos de câmbio e de investimentos, além de realizar agendamentos recorrentes e transferências inteligentes. Nos próximos meses, virão recursos que facilitam a portabilidade de salários, o Pix automático na iniciação de pagamentos e a facilitação do compartilhamento do Open Finance, inclusive para a área de crédito.
Os bons resultados obtidos até agora sugerem que o futuro do sistema financeiro está diretamente relacionado à “ultra centralidade no cliente”, ou seja, colocar cada cliente no centro, com personalização total no relacionamento. E, para isso, é preciso estimular o compartilhamento seguro e o uso de dados para gerar melhores ofertas e agregar valor para o consumidor.
O consentimento no Open Banking é, na prática, uma declaração do cliente a respeito do que ele espera da instituição financeira. Nesse momento, é essencial ser assertivo na resposta ao cliente, para que o relacionamento seja de transparência e eficiência.
A personalização, segundo os especialistas, não só contribui para atender à expectativa do cliente, mas, também, ajuda a eliminar fricções na jornada. Porém, para escalar a personalização, é preciso saber como fazer a correta estruturação e integração dos dados. Não à toa, 83% dos bancos estão comprometidos em 2024 com a experiência do cliente e 63%, com a personalização de produtos e serviços, segundo a Pesquisa Febraban de Tecnologia Bancária 2024.
Cada vez mais, as instituições financeiras usam inteligência de dados para oferecer um atendimento mais humanizado em seus canais digitais, por onde passam mais de 70% das transações, baseando-se em conceitos como os de Emotion AI e Empathetic Banking, capazes de fazer leituras emocionais dos clientes. Assim, o banco pode sugerir serviços mais customizados com base nessas informações, por meio de chatbots, assistentes de voz e agentes na interação ao vivo nos próprios aplicativos bancários.
Nesse ciclo virtuoso, existe um espaço ainda maior para o uso de Inteligência Artificial. A IA entra forte no Open Banking de várias maneiras, na segurança dos usuários e como uma oportunidade para trazer insights e entender do que os clientes realmente precisam, de forma personalizada. O grande desafio, nesse sentido, é fazer a seleção e orquestração dos dados, reunindo informações dos mais diversos canais para entender cada pessoa de forma individualizada.
A IA melhora os meios de pagamentos e auxilia cada vez mais na adaptação de serviços, interfaces e interações bancárias para atender às necessidades e preferências. Ainda de acordo com a Pesquisa Febraban de Tecnologia Bancária 2024, a Inteligência Artificial, especialmente a generativa (GenAI), vem sendo utilizada por 54% dos bancos e revela-se altamente adaptável e customizável às necessidades específicas de cada área de negócio das instituições. O levantamento indicou que, para os bancos que já implementaram a IA, a eficiência dos processos se elevou a uma taxa média de 11%.
Na área de segurança, as soluções também contam com IA embarcada para aprendizado rápido e autoproteção instantânea. A tendência, num futuro próximo, é que haja um agente de IA integrado no dia a dia do cliente ajudando-o nas emergências. Não se trata mais de segmentação. A ideia é entender o que o cliente está fazendo e entregar facilidades para a evolução de sua jornada individual quase em tempo real.
O uso de Inteligência Artificial generativa deverá quebrar a barreira que existe entre as pessoas e máquinas, ao capturar o estado atual do cliente pela análise de seu tom de voz e da forma como digita sua mensagem.
Com o avanço crescente da tecnologia, chegará o momento em que será possível perceber se a pessoa está ofegante, aflita, precisando de uma resposta rápida de um empréstimo para resolver um problema urgente. Com o uso da IA, o banco empático poderá incluir nas conversas expressões locais como o ""trem"", para os mineiros, e o ""tchê"", dos gaúchos, ou o chiado carioca, para humanizar ainda mais as interações nos canais digitais.
Embedded Finance
A IA também alavancará o Embedded Finance (finanças embarcadas), tendência que busca integrar serviços financeiros em produtos ou plataformas em outros setores que não o financeiro. No varejo, por exemplo, existem redes que já disponibilizam o consignado dentro do supermercado.
Segundo a Pesquisa Future Market Insights de 2023, o tamanho do mercado do Embedded Finance no mundo deve atingir US$ 200 bilhões em 2030 – expectativa de US$ 15 bilhões na América Latina.
Quanto maior a oferta de serviços financeiros, maior a possibilidade de aumentar o envolvimento do cliente, proporcionando uma experiência completa. O uso de programas de fidelidade e créditos como parte do Embedded Finance não apenas aumenta o engajamento do cliente, mas também oferece oportunidades para as empresas monetizarem esses programas. Já os consumidores podem se beneficiar da conveniência e personalização de serviços financeiros, uma vez que o Embedded Finance proporciona maior conforto e possibilidade de personalizar produtos e serviços de acordo com o perfil de cada usuário.
Nesse contínuo processo de evolução do sistema financeiro, os bancos começam a se integrar um pouco mais com as moedas digitais e a enxergar que está surgindo uma nova tecnologia capaz de melhorar a relação entre as instituições financeiras e o consumidor.
Com a capacidade de representar ativos digitais de forma tokenizada, os bancos podem criar ofertas mais flexíveis e personalizadas para atender às necessidades dos clientes, desenvolvendo novas soluções. A experiência com o Drex deverá alavancar negócios em outros países, onde a moeda digital ainda nem é pauta, pois ainda se discutem as transações instantâneas, cuja adesão no mercado brasileiro segue em ascensão. Segundo dados do Banco Central, o Pix foi responsável por adicionar 71,5 milhões de usuários no sistema financeiro nacional, promovendo a bancarização.
Com todas as transformações vivenciadas nos últimos anos pelo sistema financeiro no país – do nascimento do Pix à implementação do Open Finance, chegada do Drex e geração de novas oportunidades com a economia tokenizada –, fica a certeza de que a próxima geração de serviços se beneficiará de alavancas como bancos quânticos, 5G, 6G, IoT e BoT (Bank of Things). A Inteligência Artificial continuará revolucionando o setor, permitindo que as relações entre clientes e bancos sejam mais ágeis, seguras e humanizadas.

Metade dos brasileiros desconhece o Open Finance, mostra pesquisa
Pesquisa Datafolha revela que 55% dos brasileiros não conhecem o Open Finance. Entenda os desafios e benefícios do sistema
Passados quatro anos da criação do Open Finance pelo Banco Central, o sistema que permite compartilhar informações entre bancos ainda é desconhecido por metade da população brasileira, de acordo com pesquisa do Datafolha.
Entre os entrevistados, em todas as regiões do Brasil, 55% nunca ouviram falar do Open Finance e outros 19% dizem estar ""mal informados"" e ""não saber quase nada"", uma sinalização de que ainda vai levar tempo para o serviço ter uso mais amplo.

A adesão tem sido maior entre as fintechs e bancos digitais, com 17 milhões de consentimentos ativos, dos 30 milhões que o sistema chegou em 2024.
A pesquisa do Datafolha revelou que só 5% dos brasileiros afirmaram estar ""bem informados"" sobre o Open Finance, enquanto 22% dizem estar ""mais ou menos"" informados.
O Datafolha entrevistou 1.452 pessoas com conta bancária em 113 cidades brasileiras de todas as regiões. O levantamento faz parte de um estudo da Zetta, a entidade que reúne fintechs e bancos digitais, e foi apresentado ontem ao Banco Central.
""É preciso ter em mente que o Open Finance é uma agenda de desenvolvimento gradual, pensada e estruturada para ser implementada em fases, das mais simples às mais complexas"", afirma o presidente da Zetta, Eduardo Lopes.
Para que essa agenda avance e mais pessoas venham a aderir ao Open Finance, ele defende a necessidade de avanços regulatórios e mais comunicação dos bancos.
Também é preciso mais casos de uso pela população e aqui ele usa a comparação com o Pix, que pegou rapidamente na população.
O Open Finance, argumenta Lopes, é uma solução mais abstrata do que o Pix, que é um produto.

Nesse sistema, as pessoas se beneficiam, por exemplo, vendo em um só aplicativo o seu saldo em contas de diferentes bancos, mas nem sempre se dão conta de que o que está por trás daquela funcionalidade é o Open Finance.
""Não vemos as pessoas falando 'hoje eu usei o Open Finance'. É uma solução mais abstrata.""
Desconhecendo os benefícios
No geral, o conhecimento do Open Finance é maior entre as pessoas de mais renda e maior escolaridade.
Porém, também chama atenção na pesquisa que as pessoas que afirmam conhecer o sistema, ou ter ao menos algum conhecimento, não estão percebendo os benefícios de seu uso.
A possibilidade de conseguir juros menores nos bancos ao aderir ao Open Finance foi citada por apenas 4% das pessoas como os maiores atrativos, assim como a chance de conseguir acesso a melhores soluções de pagamento (3%), apesar destes serem dois dos principais objetivos na criação do sistema.
Dos entrevistados, 36% afirmaram não saber dos benefícios. Ainda sobre a percepção dos benefícios do Open Finance, dentre os entrevistados que não souberam indicar quais são eles, 50% pertencem às classes D e E.
Na pesquisa, entre os principais benefícios apontados pelas pessoas, 25% citaram facilidade de acesso ao crédito/aumento do limite; 23% mencionaram maior organização e praticidade na movimentação de contas e 12% a maior facilidade na consulta e compartilhamento de dados entre os bancos.

Nubank foi a instituição para a qual os entrevistados mais tentaram levar os dados, com cerca de 40%. PicPay aparece em seguida com 17% e Itaú com 14%.
A pesquisa constatou também que o uso do sistema ainda é baixo: 12% dos entrevistados compartilharam ou tentaram compartilhar dados pelo Open Finance.
Já os pagamentos e transferências feitos pelo sistema são menos comuns, informados por apenas 6% dos entrevistados.
Portabilidade
Entre as funcionalidades mais desejadas das pessoas no Open Finance está a portabilidade de salário, assim como alertas de transações suspeitas ou cobranças de juros e tarifas.
""Portabilidades via Open Finance – de crédito, salário e investimentos – é fundamental que avance rapidamente, para que as pessoas entendam os benefícios do Open Finance"", ressalta o presidente da Zetta.
""Essas portabilidades já existem, mas o processo hoje é muito burocrático, demorado e nem sempre dá certo.""
No caso dos salários, um ajuste na regulação ajudaria a tornar possível, permitindo que as contas salários façam Pix via Open Finance."

"Mask Bans Slowly Spread [cough, cough] in States and Localities
By Lambert Strether of Corrente.
In the companion post to this piece (“Eight Reasons Mask Bans Are Beyond Stupid“) I dealt with the talking points that arise in anti-mask discourse generally. There are two key points: (1) “Health Masks” can be distinguished conceptually and visually from “face coverings” proper (balaclava, Klan hood), and (2) Health Masks do not conceal identity[1]. In this post, I will track how the anti-mask effort is working out, both in jurisdictions where mask bans passed (North Carolina, Nassau County, NY), and where they have only been proposed, with varying degrees of seriousness (New York State, Chicago IL, Los Angeles, CA)[2],[3]. Although the politics are enjoyably horrid, especially in Nassau County, I will present the text of the statutes or bills, and focus on two key issues: Health Exemptions, and Health Mask Removal.
Jurisdictions Where Mask Bans Passed: North Carolina, Nassau County, NY
First, let’s look at North Carolina (chronologically the leader of the pack). House Bill 237is here.
Here is the Health Exemption:
I find much to like in this language (though Peoples CDC disagrees). For one thing, it focuses on visible and testable characteristics of the Health Mask (see here in the previous post), and not on intent. For another, “preventing the spread of contagious disease” is certainly why I wear a mask; I’m preventing the spread both to me, and from me (if I have Covid, but don’t know it). Conveniently, the contagious disease is not specified; many anecdotes testify to the utility of masks in preventing other contagious respiratory dieases, like colds and flu. Finally, it is easy to see how, in future, the language could be modified to protect against, say, allergies or wildfire smoke.
And here is the Mask Removal rule:
This is bad: Transmission Can Take Place In Seconds When a Health Mask Is Removed. As a result, Health Mask Bans Mandate Infection. A little noticed aspect of mask removal is that infection is a two-way street; if a cop demands that a mask-wearer remove their mask, the mask-wearer may — knowingly or, given that Covid spreads asymptomatically, unknowingly — infect the cop. In seconds. The “infection mandate” applies to the cop too. (I don’t know of the police unions have considered this, but they ought to.) Personally, I think mask removal isn’t categorized properly, though I don’t know how to express this in legal terms. We’re thinking of it as a traffic light stop or an ID check, but given the potential dire consequences, we should put it in the “warrant required” bucket.
Note the distinction between “removal” in (c)(i) and “temporary removal” in (c)(ii). “Temporary” means a quick lift of the mask for an identity check. But the net effect is to leave cops less protected than property owners. Is that the intent of the bill? Better language would define the maximum length of removal, if legal, hopefully in terms of seconds.
Here’s a brief history of the bill, which passed only through the classic tactic of combining it with another “must-pass” piece of legislation. From the Daily Tar Heel:
While it originated in the N.C. House of Representatives as a bipartisan bill to criminalize money laundering and increase penalties for crimes committed while wearing face masks, Republicans in the N.C. Senate pushed for the removal of the state’s public health exemption that was established in 2020.
The enacted legislation is a compromise between the House and Senate, largely negotiated by a conference committee established after the House failed to concur with the Senate’s bill.
“I think we got the bill at least to a softer spot, where people understand if they want to wear a mask they can wear a mask and not be fearful of the law,” Rep. John Torbett (R-108), one of the bill’s original sponsors who served on the conference committee, said at the bill’s veto override vote on June 26.
Here speaks a man who has never been subject to arbitary arrest! (“Police Discretion for Enforcing Mask Bans Is Discriminatory“). More:
The campaign finance portions of the bill were written while the bill was in conference committee,limiting the amount of time both chambers had to debate them.
No doubt!
Now, let’s look at Nassau County, NY. The “Mask Transparency Act” is here. Here are the Health Exemption and Mask Removal rules:
In the Health Exemption, as opposed to NC’s “medical or surgical” language, the Long Island Law exempts based on intent: “worn to protect the health or safety of the wearer.” How on earth is this to be determined? Or are we to regard masks worn as part of “the right of the people peaceably to assemble” as not meeting that exemption, by definition?
The Mask Removal is much worse than NC’s; there’s no notion of “temporary removal” (and IANAL, but the addition of “intention to partake” to “reasonable suspicion” looks awfully sketchy to me). The net result seems to be granting cops even more power to make arbitrary arrests than they already have.
Hilariously, the author of the “Mask Transparency Act,” Mazi Melesa Pilip, is a former IDF paratrooper (here see the Appendix)[4]. The law from its inception having become imbricated with protests against genocidal policies in Israel and environs, the mood at the hearing was ugly. From Jews for Mask Rights, “Anti-Mask Harassment at Nassau County’s Mask Ban Hearing“:
Throughout the nearly seven-hour hearing, masked attendees were subjected to ongoing harassment. Some immunocompromised individuals were intentionally coughed on. Ban supporters told mask-wearers they couldn’t wait for their masks to be removed. Ban supporters pointed at, laughed at, and filmed[5] disabled attendees. They made discriminatory remarks, even yelling out to arrest those in masks. Ban supporters harassed at least one speaker on their way out of the building. Law enforcement and government officials made minimal attempts to curb the vitriol, which only emboldened those perpetuating it.
Former Mayor Wayne Hall, an immunocompromised kidney transplant recipient, was the first to speak against the mask ban. The crowd loudly booed the elected official at the mere mention of COVID-19 remaining a threat to his health.
One co-writer of our Jews for Mask Rights open letter was booed during her testimony about her concerns about the bill and her struggle with Long COVID. The crowd yelled obscenities when she shared her fears about harassment – a valid fear, considering another co-writer had been harrassed for masking in NYC just that morning. The irony of a group allegedly “opposing hate speech” and “concerned with Jewish safety” mocking a mocking a disabled Jewish speaker was not lost on us.
In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. But spectacle like this don’t make that easy:
One of the advocates opposing the Nassau County mask ban was violently arrested by the cops at the meeting, as shown on this News 12 segment. Cops are already disproportionately targeting higher risk people wearing a mask before the mask ban is even signed into law. https://t.co/Hl27MfUi8w pic.twitter.com/gwKlzhwxdP

From CBS, here’s a brief timeline.
Nassau County lawmakers passed a bill making it a crime for anyone to wear a mask or face covering to hide their identity in public.
The vote on the controversial Mask Transparency Act split along party lines, with 12 Republicans voting for it and seven Democrats abstaining.
Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who has spoken in support of the bill, is now expected to sign it.
Supporters claim the measure will help combat crimes committed during protests and only applies to bad actors, not those wearing face coverings for religious or health reasons.
But opponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Democratic leaders, called the law flawed and dangerous for allowing police to stop and question any person in public who is wearing a mask, even if no crime is being committed.
And then there’s the outcome of a complete dereliction of duty (granted, for some defintion of duty) by the public health establishment. That’s why people are uttering nonsense like the following:
“To be honest with you, I feel like if you aren’t feeling well, you should put your mask on, right? [no knowledge of asymptomatic tranmission] I feel it’s sort of not fair. But then again, shopkeepers want to you have the mask off,” resident Nancy Wellbrock said.
“The police are not stupid, they have a good IQ. So they’ll know what’s right and what’s wrong,” another resident added [and surely be smart enough to know when health and safety are at risk].
“The pandemic is over [no, it’s not]. Why are you still wearing a mask? You’ve got to be hiding something [and so what],” said Ernel Dixon, who works in Nassau County. “So it’s unfortunate, but has to be done.”
Jurisdictions Where Mask Bans Have Been Considered: New York State, Chicago IL, Los Angeles, CA
There’s a lot of heat but not much light in New York State. I want to focus on one player: Governor Kathy Hochul. Here Hochul explains why she’s considering a mask ban:
Reverend Al Sharpton, MSNBC: Let me raise another issue. You’re working right now with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and other state lawmakers to explore a possible crackdown on masks, especially on public transit. You cited concerns about antisemitic attacks and crime that we’ve seen that all of us have denounced while critics have argued mask ban could be bad for public health and could infringe on religious expression and other civil liberties. Where does the mask ban idea stand at the moment?
Governor Hochul: This was as a result of just the horror that people experienced when they saw people with masks coming on a subway train, threatening and intimidating innocent passengers. But also, I immediately said, ‘If there is to be consideration of a mask ban, we of course will make accommodations for health.‘ If people want to wear surgical masks on the subway, go ahead and do it. Probably people who have less colds, less cases of COVID, that’s fine.
Hochul is lying. Assembly Bill A10057A was introduced on May 2, 2024. It reads in relevant part:
It’s worse than NC’s anti-mask bill, worse even than Nassau County’s. There is no health exemption, and there are no mask removal rules. From the Albany Times-Union, “Editorial: No hiding flaws of proposed mask ban“:
Granted, we have yet to see legislative language from Ms. Hochul [see above], who says she plans to work with the Legislature to fine-tune a proposal that would target violent mask wearers while protecting peaceful protesters and religious attire. But we suspect no amount of tuning could hide the proposal’s inherent contradictions.
Even if the law is crafted to allow the wearing of religious face coverings [in there] and the N-95s [not there] offered last summer to protect New Yorkers from smoke, wouldn’t criminals simply choose to wear similar coverings? How will police judge who is legitimately wearing a mask and who isn’t? The impulse would be to target those who look suspicious, whatever that means, raising concerns about selective and prejudicial enforcement.
And Hochul, it seems, is also lying about the putatively precipitating incident. From the Forward:
Hochul’s argument is that banning masks will reduce instances of antisemitic harassment, because people will be less able to hide their faces. However, the incident that precipitated this announcement, in which an unmasked protester shouted that Zionists should get off the train, makes clear how flimsy the governor’s logic is. This proposed ban is not about combating antisemitism, but about the appearance of taking action against antisemitism. It’s nothing more than a political ploy.
For an interlude of light entertainment, see TimeOut: “Here’s what we should ban on the subway instead of masks“: Nail clipping (and any other bodily cast-offs); pole-leaning; gratuitous PDA. And much else!
Now let’s turn to Chicago, IL. Here is the proposed ordinance:
Like the New York State bill, no health exemption, no mask removal policy. But again, “Health Masks Do Not Work to Conceal Identity.” Does Lopez plan to ban sunglasses, too?
This one, so far, hasn’t gone anywhere. From Axios Chicago: “Lopez emphasized that mask wearing only becomes a problem under his proposal ‘if you are breaking the law.'”
Finally, let’s turn to Los Angeles, CA. There is no text, fortunately; only vague handwaving from Mayor Karen Bass who, hilariously sadly, just got Covid:
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass began the week by suggesting that her city consider a new mask ban for protesters, and ended it by testing positive for Covid-19.
After protesters clashed outside a synagogue in Pico-Robertson, which held an event for a company known for selling high-end properties in Israel’s illegal settlements in the West Bank, Democratic leaders quickly denounced the chaos and began working on ways to make everything a lot less safe for protesters.
The one bright spot in the whole sorry mess is that we got to hear from Violet Affleck:
Violet Affleck holding it down at the LA County Board of Supervisors demanding mask availability, mask mandates in hospitals, and clean air in all government buildings including jails and detention centers. Go Violet! 😷🍉 pic.twitter.com/B8PN3jl5F6
— Joaquín Beltrán for a Free Palestine (@joaquinlife) July 10, 2024
(The account, Joaquín Beltrán, is the one elected I see as solid on Covid.) From Harper’s Bazaar:
“I demand masks availability, air filtration, and far-UVC light in government facilities—including jails and detention centers—and mask mandates in county medical facilities,” she said. “You must expand the availability of high-quality free tests and treatment and, most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason.”
Affleck concluded, “[Mask bans] do not keep us safer. They make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.”
Good for her.
Conclusion
There’s a lot of blame to go around here. How did a proven and above all non-pharmaceutical intervention become a matter of social opprobium and a target of, well, hate? By order of culpability, the ruling class. For reasons best known to themselves, the ruling class hate masks (see NC here). As a result, nobody is anybody models mask wearing (looking at you, Taylor Swift, Billionaire Superspreader), and they have never become a social norm (as they are, for example, in parts of Asia). Second, the public health establishment, especially the CDC, where mask advocacy was collateral damage as the experts fought aerosol tranmission tooth and nail (and Fauci constantly shifted the goalposts on which masks were reliable and which were not). Third, the left, who should have protected their putative working class base, and instead saw brunch as more important (looking at you, DSA, but also at NGO after NGO after NGO. Labor, too. Why in the name of all that is holy weren’t unions, in general, vehmently in favor of protecting their members from a virulent airborne pathogen?). And finally, of course, our electeds, prominent among them Trump and Biden, both of whom, for their own peculiar reasons, dissed masks and sought to get rid of them as soon as possible.
I’m so old I remember when masks were at least a matter of “you do you.” Remember that?
NOTES
[1] These posts focus solely on trying to protect people’s ability to protect themselves (and others) from Covid using health masks (yes, they are effective). Civil liberties concerns are out of scope, except insofar as they enable theories of the case that would protect the Covid-conscious in litigation. For an approach that unifies these concerns, see the Death Panel podcast here. Also out of scope is harrassment of mask-wearers in retail establishments. For example:
Went to grocery store.
Loudspeaker announcement 2 minutes after I walk in:
""Security, watch the cameras, black bag & wearing a mask""
I'm carrying a black canvas bag
I'm the only person masking

Interestingly, the Defender of Association of Philadelphia woudl argue this is a “dress code restriction” — remember the moral panic about saggy pants? — and hence ineffective in deterring crime.
[2] In another toddler-level libertarian assault on public health, there are also laws being passed to prevent mask mandates. Here’s a map of such efforts at the state level; at the Federal level, Senator and Vice-Presidential candidate J.D. Vance introduced the “Freedom to Breathe Act,” which would prevent funding for mask mandates on airplanes. Of course, the short title is ridiculous; breathability is a concern for all health masks (although it is difficult to breathe with POTS, or in a hospital with your lungs filling with bloody mush, but that’s all a matter of personal risk assessment, I suppose). These too are out of scope for this post.
[3] There is also an anti-mask model statute from the Manhattan Institute, but so far as I can tell, none of the jurisdictions I have looked at used it. Perhaps they took their cues from existing legislation (Texas, Florida, Ohio).
[4] NBC: “Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip proposed the bill after talking to a constituent she said was attacked at a recent protest. Pilip said she wants to unmask those responsible for the violence. ‘Having them covering their faces, thinking they can do whatever they want. This is absolutely unacceptable,’ said Pilip.” It seems to me that officiousness, as a social norm, has greatly increased since 2020.
[5] This supports the theory, expressed in the previous post, that “many normal citizens want mask bans not to assist law enforcement, but for acts of vigilantism and private retribution.”
APPENDIX Nassau County
Nassau County borders Queens County, the epicenter of Covid in the United States. That makes Nassau County’s mandate for Covid infection via unmasking especially ironic, given the literal holocaust that took place in 2020:
(I can’t embed this tweet, oddly, but it’s possible to go to the URL and click to run the video.)
For a group that hated being told to wear a mask, why don’t they see the irony of them telling us not to wear a mask?
Because it’s not about logic. IMO it’s about emotion and power. It is the weaponisation of rage (which is always itself based in powerlessness).
The description of the nassau crowd would seem to support this.
See also: why the “marketplace of ideas” means nothing any more.
The more decline and jackpot we get, the more (autonomously and via propaganda) this rage will be sprayed around hitting any “other” and, I’d expect, anyone that tries to debate using logic.
[This is only one response pathway to our family-blogged world. There’s also “desperately clinging to increasingly absurd convictions” such as the government being your friend: depression; avoidance; revolution; moving away; blind hope; religion]
The film Idiocracy was supposed to be set 500 years in the future. But it seems to be happening in 2024.
. . . ” In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. But spectacle like this don’t make that easy: ” . . .
Extending that belief to “people” in general is an overbroad mistake. Some people are really good at heart. Some people are really bad at heart. I would assume that mask banners are really bad at heart and I certainly wouldn’t extend them the single benefit of a single doubt, because they do not deserve it.
The source of the quotation is The Diary of Ann Frank. Lambert’s trademark irony strikes again….
Well, I have never read The Diary of Ann Frank and shame on me for that. And I still have my chronic irony defficiency. So there are two strikes against me having gotten the referrence or the irony, or the irony of the referrence.
I took an ethics class from ROTC in college, and the instructor (an Army LTC, and surprisingly excellent) opined that something like 1 in 6 people will do the morally right thing every time and 1 in 6 will do the morally wrong thing every time. The other 4 in 6 go with the flow. He said that the number was approximate- 1 in 8 or 1 in 10, whatever, the point was that most people go with the flow and to understand where you and those around you fit to that moral/ethical curve.
Therefore 5 in 6 people are good, +/-. I still think of that point today as I have found little evidence over the last 35 years that would contradict this.
Thanks, that’s interesting. Much depends, then, on what behavior elites model. Yes?
Exactly. That was the instructor’s point.
Leadership matters, for good or bad.
I’ve been saying this for years now but the cumulative brain damage caused by Long Covid will precipitate the collapse of the United States.
Brain Foggin’ Towards Bethlehem
“Collapse” sounds kind of sudden. Perhaps it will be more along the lines of “gradual subsidence into sodden mush.”
Perhaps brain damage is a plausible interpretation of the policy of the entire Collective West.
There is a lot of antipathy to mask wearers because they remind people that COVID isn’t over.
However, there was no impetus behind mask bans until Gaza protesters concealed their identities with masks. Therefore, I consider that the primary driver of the bans.
> there was no impetus behind mask bans until Gaza protesters concealed their identities
This is a consequence of the putative Left’s enormous failure to normalize masking in their own practice, and in the portion of the population they can influence, especially labor; surely more than the 10-14% who mask today (but are rarely seen, since they avoid infectious spaces). But brunch was more important!
For that reason, it’s understandable that people would attribute a motive of identity concealment to a sudden appearance of mask-wearing en masse (even if the reality of mask-wearing is quite different; see NC here. If these guys wanted to really conceal their identities, they’d be wearing sunglasses).
So by hihacking masks for their “protests,” the putative left has managed to actually stigmatize mask-wearing — with the help of Zionists, our famously free press, and elite/public health. Thereby creating their own little genocide (see APPENDIX).
Didn’t Mayor SuperCop Adams of NYC try getting a mask ban before any Gaza protests?
The proposed face mask bans can seriously be compared to other “legitimate” threats to public safety, ie. “Shouting Covid in a crowded theatre.” The problem with this idea is that a fire in a public space soon becomes obvious, clouds of smoke, flames etc. Covid in a public space is not ‘obvious.’ The “official” logic here is that old time tested theory that “if it cannot be seen, it does not exist.” Performance as public policy. How very Neo-liberal of the Elites!
Some of the ‘elites’ are just tiny little wannabe-elite posers. They do not even exist up at the level of Neo-liberal performativity. The nasty little cruddy Nassau County counselors-or-whatever who voted in that mask ban are just nasty spiteful cruddy little nasty bad-hearted persons.
Speaking of “performativity,” I wonder who is writing the script? Or is it PMC approved “organic” information?
It reminds me of a line from the Langston Hughes play “The Old Settler.”
A younger woman has ‘stolen’ the boyfriend of an older woman. When the older woman asks the younger one why she did it, the younger woman replies: “Because I can.”
This perfectly encapsulates today’s socio-political climate in the West. Spiteful, petty people vying for ‘status’ and ‘position.’ It may have ever been so, but today, for many reasons, the rot is front and centre.
Stay safe.
At Mass today, fr wraps up with this zinger: “Keep us in your prayers, we have 12 funerals this week. The latest gentleman died yesterday. Completely unexpected.”
Something’s changed out there, stay safe people.
I get the same impression. Officially 200 deaths a day from the Coronavirus 2019 has been ‘normalized.’
When the Mpox breaks out of Africa and starts rampaging in the rest of the world, the Jackpot will ramp up a notch.
It seems to be the employment of a “Death by a thousand infections” strategy.
Se, from Jan. 2024: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/1500-americans-dying-covid-week/story?id=106237143
One of the people we were asked to “hold in the light” at church today was a medical resident who had just died suddenly and unexpectedly. The person making the request actually used that phrase.
‘Tis a mystery!
Not to defend the mask bans at all, but if forced to temporarily unmask for ID, as at airport security, one can take a deep breath to protect oneself, doff the mask briefly, then exhale after donning it again to protect others. Of course this only works if you have fairly healthy lungs…
Yes. And probably much can be done with sprays (which I have assumed are allowed through by TSA, yes?)
Yes, medical liquids allowed.
One could remove the mask and exhale deeply. If the person making the demand is nasty about it, one could even cough.
Honestly, people have become so horrible I’m starting to think a mask with an exhale valve is appropriate.
< 85 days
This is a little cryptic. Please expand
I had to demask on a recent flight, for the TSA Agent, the first airplane trip since 2019. It was not fun.
Only 2 other people were masked, and one of them who was masked at the gate actually took off her mask during the flight! I guess she knows about the air filtering capabilities on airplanes better than I.
Neosporin in the nose before I went in the airport."
"Letters to the Editor, August 12, 2024: Best for the campaign
Best for the campaign
Regarding “Harris picks Minnesota’s Walz as vice presidential running mate” (August 7): We need to stop being so paranoid and be more realistic. Kamala Harris, first and foremost, needs to win the presidency of the US, and as such needs to do what is best for the campaign.
Had she picked Josh Shapiro, it would have caused huge strife within the party and probably ugly demonstrations during the campaign rallies. It would have damaged the campaign and detracted from the momentum that Harris’s nomination has so far generated. Her choice of Tim Walz, the all-American boy, who incidentally has a good pro-Israel record, is a good one, and she can reward Shapiro after the election by giving him a senior post in her government. First, though, she needs to get there.

Sober debate
Any analysis of momentous events undoubtedly yields immediate, primary, and secondary causes. In Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Time magazine interview (“PM: ‘Deeply sorry’ for Oct. 7, but not resigning,” August 9), among these potential causes, he chose to cite “the refusal to serve because of an internal political debate” as having an effect.
Perhaps this is so. However, I can only hope he doesn’t overlook how this “internal debate” managed to generate unprecedented dissent and unprecedented responses by most sectors of Israel’s population, including the military, generating local and international ramifications. Without taking a stand on the merits of the proposed judicial reform, it seems clear that much of Israeli society was fearful, even terrified, by how the reforms were to be steamrollered through the Knesset.
After achieving a 64-member right-wing coalition, the Likud party gave new meaning to “tyranny of the majority.” Its legislative exuberance can be likened to a child given free rein in a candy shop about to close. If and when judicial reform is reintroduced, I can only hope that the legislative process will indeed be a judicious one, in which societal problems are aired in broad forums that enable sober debate that can advance the good of the country, not just that of the ruling coalition.

Altogether unacceptable
Regarding “‘Kamala Harris didn’t express interest in Israeli arms embargo’” (August 9): I’m only vaguely familiar with the Uncommitted National Movement (UNM) and its efforts to get fence-sitting Democrats fired up in support of Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign for the presidency.
Yet, while the organization is certainly permitted to lobby on her behalf, cobbling together fake news or making reference to statements or positions without providing the proper context is altogether unacceptable. So, though all may be fair in love and war, there are still, thankfully, professional constraints in politics, something about which UNM needs to be made aware. Let’s, then, give the vice president the benefit of the doubt and accept that she never expressed a willingness to discuss with UNM – or anyone else, for that matter – an arms embargo on Israel. This is not to say that the official statement released by her campaign is in any way reassuring. On the contrary, her conditions for ending the war make no mention of Hamas. Until and unless that hornet’s nest is destroyed, everything else is, for the most part, meaningless.
How sad that my vote for Donald Trump will be because he is the lesser of two evils. That he views himself as a demigod of sorts and is an undeniable danger to the values of democracy is bad enough. My concern is that he may not be as good for Israel as everybody seems to be expecting. Believe me, I hope I’m wrong.

Foreign miscreants
In principle, Finance Minister Smotrich is correct to oppose the release of convicted Palestinian terrorist murderers in exchange for Israeli hostages (“Washington slams Smotrich for criticism of hostage proposal,” August 11). There is no moral equivalence between the two groups, and the awful consequences of the previous Schalit deal, in which Yahya Sinwar was one of the prisoners released, have been terrible for Israel.
Still, it can also be argued that trading imprisoned foreign miscreants for one’s own unjustly imprisoned people has long been a part of international diplomacy, including what was practiced during the Cold War by the world’s superpowers. Perhaps the distaste over releasing Palestinian terrorist murderers can be counterbalanced by the joy of the liberation of the Israeli hostages.
No doubt it would have been preferable for our hostages to have been liberated through a military victory, and no deal which endangers a military victory should be entertained by Israel. However, the passage of time reduces the chances of any of the hostages to return alive, given their mistreatment by Hamas.
It’s a terrible dilemma which admits of no ideal solution, especially given Israel’s dependence on the US for diplomatic and military support. Ultimately, I trust Prime Minister Netanyahu to balance priorities properly, and to make the right decisions in the upcoming negotiations.

Williamsville, NY
No hatred of Israel
Hillel Frisch is accurate in his assessment of the Iranian people; their opinions do not align with those of the dictatorial reign of the ayatollahs (“Do not target the Iranian people,” August 8).
He brings evidence to show that they have no hatred of Israel. In fact, one doesn’t need to search the Internet to conclude that their hatred is reserved for the harsh regime under which they live. They have tried to rebel twice, unfortunately to no avail.
The Obama administration was particularly bad in its Iranian policy, primarily sucking up to the dictators and ignoring the people. The current Left-leaning US administration is no better.
However, Frisch’s conclusion is wrong. Crippling Iran’s oil industry would hurt the regime, not the people, because the oil revenues are used to support the regime and the terrorism it is promoting against Israel and the West in general; little is left for the long-suffering people of Iran.
Given our recent successes in assassinating leaders of our enemies, it is appropriate to continue on the offensive, regardless of the objections which may arise from our frenemies. In the Middle East, in fact in international relations in general, it’s the strong horse that earns respect.

"Race at Colonial Downs becomes a qualifier for Kentucky Derby
A high-stakes horse race at Colonial Downs could be where next year’s Kentucky Derby horses get a major leg up, with the Virginia Derby’s designation as a qualifying race for the Run for the Roses.
The Virginia Derby is slated for March 15, 2025, at the New Kent County track, if the Virginia Racing Commission approves. The race would anchor a new four-day spring meet at Colonial Downs and be part of an expanded schedule of 47 race days, up from the current 27.
The winner of the Virginia Derby will earn 50 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown. The winning horse will be guaranteed a post position in the starting gate for the 151st Kentucky Derby on May 3, 2025.
“The future for thoroughbred racing in Virginia is bright, and this opportunity will allow us to shine on horseracing’s biggest stage,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin, announcing the Virginia Derby’s designation at the kickoff to Colonial Downs’ annual Festival of Racing on Sunday.
People are also reading…
“Churchill Downs has worked with partners throughout the commonwealth to reinvigorate Virginia’s proud legacy of thoroughbred racing and secure our place as a world-class destination for racing fans and equine talent from around the world and in our own backyard.”
The three-day festival features 30 races with purses totaling more than $3 million, including the $1 million “Arlington Million,” the first thoroughbred race to offer a purse of $1 million. It is for horses 3 years old and up and is run over 1.25 miles. In addition, the festival features the Beverly D. Stakes, a 1 3/16-mile race for thoroughbred fillies and mares 3 years old and older with a purse of $500,000, and the Secretariat Stakes, a 1-mile race for 3-year-olds, which also has a $500,000 purse.
Shortly after acquiring Colonial Downs in 2022 and securing the racing commission’s approval for 27 live race dates at Colonial Downs, Churchill Downs moved the three races to Colonial Downs. They had been run at the Arlington Park racetrack in suburban Chicago before its closing.
“Our company is proud to fulfill our promise to invest in the horseracing industry in Virginia, and we are thrilled to deepen that interest with an expanded race schedule at Colonial Downs and by placing the commonwealth’s signature race, the Virginia Derby, on the prestigious Road to the Kentucky Derby,” said Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen.
Churchill Downs acquired Colonial Downs as part of its $2.75 billion acquisition of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment, a deal that also secured it six Rosie’s Gaming Emporium historical horse racing facilities across Virginia. Rosie’s operates 2,600 historical horse racing terminals at Rosie’s locations in Richmond, Vinton, Hampton, Collinsville and Dumfries, as well as at Colonial Downs itself.
The purchase also included the Del Lago Resort & Casino in Waterloo, New York, and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Sioux City, Iowa.
Colonial Downs opened in 1997 but was shuttered from 2013 to 2019 before the General Assembly authorized slot machine-like historical horse racing machines as a way to revive the track and a faltering equine industry in Virginia.
Youngkin’s concerns about another slot machine-like device, electronic skill games, has stalled a push by the General Assembly to legalize these. The legislature banned them in 2020, but convenience stores say they have become a vital source of revenue."

"4 Times You Should Pick a Credit Union Over a Traditional Bank
4 Times You Should Pick a Credit Union Over a Traditional Bank
People tend to have strong opinions about where they store their money, and rightly so. Your bank or credit union is one of the most important institutions you can have in your life. The onus is on them to protect your wealth, help you generate more of it and give you an experience that makes you feel valued.

It’s worth asking questions when you’re deciding whether to pick a credit union or a bank. Though credit unions and banks offer many of the same services, products and safety nets, they are unique entities.
The key distinction: a credit union is a not-for-profit financial institution. Deposits, generally up to $250,000, are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund through the NCUA. A bank, on the other hand, operates for profit. Deposits in most banks — also generally up to $250,000 — are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
When is it better to pick a credit union over a bank? It’s an intricate question, given that they do share many qualities. However, experts do see instances where a credit union is the more appropriate choice.

When You Need Lower Fees and Higher Rates
Banks are increasingly competitive in the area of fees, with many — especially younger online banks — aggressively boasting low, or in some cases, no fees on certain products. Still, credit unions tend to have lower fees than banks.
“First, if you are interested in lower fees, credit unions generally have fewer and lower fees than banks — they are a good way to minimize your account maintenance costs,” said Erika Kullberg, a personal finance expert and the founder of Erika.com.
Kullberg added that credit unions often pay higher rates on savings accounts and loans, enabling you to generate wealth that way.

“Credit unions tend to be more member-focused and often offer more personal service,” Kullberg said. “As not-for-profit, member-owned institutions, credit unions place more emphasis on the needs of their customers, which often results in more personalized and flexible service. You might see this as a definite advantage if you prize the sense of community that you can get from banking with a financial institution in your community.”
When You’re Trying To Qualify For a Loan and Don’t Have Great Credit
Credit unions can make it easier to qualify for loans or credit in general, Kullberg said, adding that this is a bonus for those with “not-so-excellent credit histories.”
When You Don’t Plan To Move Away
Credit unions prioritize their local communities and may not have much brick-and-mortar presence once you go beyond a certain ZIP code.
“They won’t offer a lot of branches outside of your home region, because they’re focused on serving the members of their home community,” said Scott Lieberman, founder at Touchdown Money. “If you like where you live, a credit union makes sense.”

"Alfonso Cuarón Remembers David Fincher Told Him to ‘Wait 6 Years’ to Make ‘Gravity’: ‘There’s No Tech’

Before the groundbreaking, visually stunning space thriller “Gravity” won Alfonso Cuarón his first Academy Award for Best Director, it was just an idea the filmmaker and his son banged out hoping to scrounge up some money from studios. As reported by Deadline, this weekend, prior to receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award at Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland, Cuarón participated in the latest session of the masterclass series held there where he discussed the fallout from “Children of Men” that led to him making “Gravity,” as well as the technical and financial challenges he faced along the way.
“After ‘Children of Men,’ which was a complete commercial flop ($70 million worldwide on a $76 million budget), the appetite to work with me plummeted,” Cuarón said. “So I started writing and developing a film with my son. I started prepping and the cast featured Charlotte Gainsbourg and Guillaume Canet. It was about a road trip from the South of France to the north of Scotland. It was very difficult to finance and the film fell apart. At the same time, I was going through the worst times in my personal life.”
Cuarón went on to share how he was “completely out of money” and told his collaborators that he needed to keep working, “but no arty shit.” He needed a project “that would let a studio give me a check.”
Cuarón went on to outline and script “Gravity” with his son, Jonas, but when they presented it to Warner Bros., the studio wasn’t willing to give them much money. To add to his struggles, after bringing the project to frequent collaborator, DP Emmanuel Lubezki, Cuarón realized the film may be more technologically ambitious than he initially assumed. He consulted fellow director David Fincher, but was only further dissuaded from pursuing the project.
“Fincher told us to forget about it, there’s no tech, wait 6 years. And he wasn’t wrong,” Cuarón said. “James Cameron told us how we could do it but that was a $400 million film. We told him only you can do that. And he said yeah you’re right. So we developed our own way.”
Utilizing Industrial Light & Magic’s LED-based StageCraft technology known as The Volume, as well as a mix of animation, Cuarón and Lubezki found a way to capture the look and feeling of space in-camera.
“We developed the film over three or four years technologically,” he said. “Thank God we had an exec who was very geeky.”
Unfortunately, Warner Bros. was also intent on testing “Gravity” before an audience prior to the film’s complex VFX work being completed. As Cuarón predicted, the film tested poorly, with audiences slamming the visuals and the studio subsequently started showing reservations towards the project. However, he told the audience at Locarno that “thanks to film festivals,” the project became a commercial success.
“It opened at Venice and the reception was amazing,” said Cuarón. “That’s when the studio started to love it.”
In addition to garnering seven Academy Awards, “Gravity” also earned $732 million at the box office, allowing Cuarón to pursue personal projects again with his 2018 Spanish-language Oscar winner, “Roma.”

"Israel creates plan to bring in more foreign workers in place of Palestinians
The Israeli Finance Ministry is creating a plan to replace Palestinian workers with foreign workers from abroad for construction projects in the country, the ministry announced on Sunday.
The Israeli government has been working to encourage and strengthen the residential construction industry since the outbreak of the October 7 war, the ministry said. They've noted the shortage of manpower in the field of construction.
The ministry noted that a grant was recently approved to them to issue a one-time payment to Israeli construction workers up to the amount of NIS 21 thousand.
Actions taken by Smotrich
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich asked Interior Minister Moshe Arbel to update the regulations defining the methods of paying foreign workers in the construction industry, which includes allowing the postponement of part of the payment to a foreign worker until the employee arrives in Israel.
All of this is part of efforts to ease the process of importing foreign workers into the country and supporting their employers in response to inquiries from corporations and contractors.
Smotrich said, ""We've reduced regulation and brought over 20 thousand foreign workers into the country since the beginning of the Gaza war.
""Already in the first months of the war, I announced a tremendous incentive program for those who would enter the construction industry. The current activity of the construction industry is of national interest, and we will continue to assist it while maintaining the economy and security of Israel."""
"Suze Orman Says Ignoring This Will Ruin Your Investment Future – Here's What You Must Do Now To Secure Financial Success
Suze Orman Says Ignoring This Will Ruin Your Investment Future – Here's What You Must Do Now To Secure Financial Success
Suze Orman, the acclaimed financial guru known for her straight-talking advice, warns about what she sees as the biggest danger to your investment future. In a recent episode of her hit podcast, Women & Money, entitled ""Suze School: Avoid the Biggest Danger to Your Future Investments,"" Orman broke down the critical mistakes many investors make and how to dodge them.
Don't Miss:
Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.
Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average?
Orman, a No. 1 New York Times Bestselling author and a go-to name in personal finance, kicked off with a story that rings true for many investors. She talked about a friend who regretted not buying stock in a company before it soared in value. ""Your biggest danger to your future investment success is your past wishes,"" Orman warned.
She pointed out how easy it can be to get lost in regret over a lost opportunity. “At some point in your investment career, you look at stocks like Nvidia, Apple, or Amazon – companies that just exploded in value – and you just think, ‘If only I had taken $10,000 and bought that stock when,’ it would be worth millions today.”
See Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.
Still, Orman pointed out that this mindset can be one of the biggest pitfalls. “You spend all your time calculating how much money you could have made, and then you waste more time hunting for the next big thing.”
Orman also encouraged investors to look for current opportunities rather than missed ones. “There are always good stocks out there,” she said, encouraging listeners to invest in things that have more opportunity for expansion and growth rather than running after yesterday’s giants. “Don’t let your past regrets cloud your judgment. Look at what’s available now and invest wisely.“
Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.
Orman also warned against anxious investing – a common issue she's seen throughout her nearly 40-year career. ""People get so caught up in watching the markets and the news,"" she said. ""When stocks go up, they fear missing out. When they go down, they panic."" Orman stressed that emotional reactions can lead to bad decisions. ""You see stocks going down, and suddenly you're depressed and worried. That's when mistakes happen.""
Her advice? Stay calm and stick to your strategy. ""If you've invested in good-quality stocks or ETFs, sometimes it's best to stop watching the markets altogether. Over the long run, they'll likely be just fine,"" Orman reassured.
See Also: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.
The financial guru’s main take-away is to invest using a dollar-cost averaging method – a strategy she has long recommended. “You have to view a market decline as your friend,” she said. ""When there's chaos in the markets, you should start dollar-cost averaging. It's a way to take advantage of lower prices without trying to time the market.""
Orman reminded her audience not to rush into investments out of fear of missing out. ""Nothing goes straight up,"" she said. ""If a stock does rise rapidly and looks strong, don't be afraid to buy more. But always be patient.""
Finally, Orman underscored the importance of staying committed to your investments, even when the markets get rough. ""The key to financial success is not panicking during tough times,"" she concluded. ""Stocks will go up and down – that's how the market works. But if you remain brave, stick to your plan, and avoid selling too early, you'll set yourself up for long-term success.""

"The Irish Times view on tax and the budget: the scope for real relief is limited
The pre-budget speculation seems to get earlier every year. Ahead of the October package there are already clear indications of the major tax changes planned for budget day and no shortage of suggestions about other possibilities. It is important to put these in context, both in relation to the short-term impact on take-home pay and the long-term issues facing the public finances.
Significant changes to income tax credits and bands are needed if the taxation burden is not to rise as wages increase. Put another way, there are many years in which this did not happen, leading to a stealth increase in the tax burden.
This means that much of the €1.4 billion set aside for a budget tax package will, in fact, go on adjusting the system for wage inflation. This will cost more than €1 billion and elsewhere the room to deliver real increases in people’s living standards via tax changes is limited.
The public should, therefore, treat talk of “giveways” with some scepticism. There will be real tax relief in the budget, but it will be modest enough.

Kamala Harris’s storming opening salvo has left Donald Trump scrambling to regain his early momentum
The longer-term context is also important. The exchequer finances have been supported by an extraordinary rise in corporate tax payments. Nobody knows whether this will continue at current levels, continue to rise, or fall back over the next few years.
Department of Finance warnings that around half of all corporate receipts may be classified as “windfall” – in the sense that they are linked more to tax planning than activity in the Irish economy – are worth paying attention to. However, the extent of the risk faced is hard to calibrate. What should guide policy, however, is not using the windfall aspect of these revenues to pay for ongoing spending commitments.
Against this backdrop, bodies such as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Commission on Taxation have warned taxes are likely to have to rise in the medium term rather than fall. This is based not only on the uncertainties of corporation tax but also on the bills coming down the road due to an ageing population and climate change.
Irish politicians have yet to face up to this. Bar plans for a modest rise in PRSI and increases in carbon tax, there has been little done to prepare or to identify where other tax could be raised. The report of the Commission on Taxation, which addressed this subject in detail, has not been given the attention it deserves.
The concern now is Budget 2025 will make matters worse by narrowing the tax base further, for example via changes in inheritance tax, or an extension of the ill-advised mortgage interest relief reintroduced last year. Tax revenue is now heavily concentrated on corporate tax and on income tax paid by higher earners. If there is a downturn, the exchequer finances could again be exposed."
"From Citi to 3i to Hindenburg's crosshairs, the many lives of banker turned investor Anil Ahuja
Ahuja was among the first to make a private equity bet on the Adani Group, while he was at 3i Infrastructure, which he joined in 2005. In 2007, 3i made the first investment from its Indian infrastructure fund, paying $227 million (Rs897 crore at the time) for an undisclosed stake in Adani Power Ltd, then a fully-owned subsidiary of flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. According to a TOI report, with the enterprise value of Adani Power pegged at Rs 10,850 crore, 3i's equity stake in Adani Power worked out to around 8%. This was 3i’s largest transaction in India since it started investing in the country in mid-2005. It held onto the stock for over seven years. When it sold a 2% block in the company in 2014, VC Circle calculated a 25-30% loss in pound sterling (40% in dollar terms) largely on account of sharp depreciation of the Indian currency. Ahuja left 3i in 2013 and joined IPE Plus Advisors in January 2014.
Read More: Madhabi Buch made disclosures, investors should read Hindenburg disclaimer: Sebi
The Adani Power investment, said people in the private equity industry, was one of the many misfires that eventually led to 3i, a London-listed company part-owned by the eponymous British private equity group, to stop investing in India in 2013, following a period of volatility and poor returns. Of the $875 million that the fund deployed in seven investments in India from its $1.2 billion 3i India Fund under the watch of Ahuja, it failed to exit a single investment in six years. Adani Power was the only holding that got listed on the Indian bourses in 2009, but the value of 3i's stake in the firm, purchased for $227 million in 2007, dropped by around $85 million, according to ET's calculations from that period.
As of March 2013, the fund's India investments were valued at about 80% of their cost in dollar terms, 3i said in an official statement in May 2013. In a report in the same month on 3i’s shift in its investment thesis, the Financial Times cited Iain Scouller, analyst at Oriel Securities, as saying, “the main negative appears to have been the share price of Adani Power and the weakness of the Indian rupee against sterling, with the Indian portfolio seeing an unrealised loss of £26.3 million. The European portfolio performance was much better, with an unrealised gain of £51 million.”
In the same year, Ahuja left the firm after having worked there about eight years, recalled a former colleague of his who knew him well from his earlier stint as a Citi banker.
Ahuja said he does not recollect the details of those investments as they were “a long time ago” and added, “I had taken a call to retire when I turned 50 and I did. The Adani Power exit must have happened after I left 3i.”

Blast from the past
The latest Hindenburg report comes almost a decade after his earlier investment bets in Indian power plants, toll roads and utilities came under scrutiny following massive write-offs. Ahuja is also a former director in two Adani Group companies.
“I have been teaching underprivileged kids for last six years,” Ahuja told ET from Singapore, where he is currently based, adding that he’s also engaged in the study of religious scriptures. “These allegations came as a bolt from the blue.”
That’s a departure from the image of Ahuja that several of Ahuja’s peers, colleagues and promoters of portfolio gave ET--that of a banker-turned- hard charging PE-boss with a penchant for Maserati sports cars.
Hindenburg says IPE Plus Fund was set up by Ahuja through wealth management firm India Infoline (IIFL). According to the US short-seller, Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch had invested in this fund in June 2015, which was also drawn upon by Vinod Adani, brother of billionaire businessman Gautam Adani. At the end of December 2017, the IPE Plus Fund had only $38.43 million in assets under management (AUM), as per IIFL disclosures. Buch and her husband said they pulled out of the fund when Ahuja left in 2018.
Interestingly, Buch joined the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, the same year that Ahuja passed out–1986. Ahuja’s wife, Latika Monga Ahuja also passed out from the same B-School and as per her LinkedIn profile is a director of Piramal Asset Management Pte Ltd, Singapore.
“Beyond being used as an alleged funnel for Vinod Adani’s money,” the fund and its CIO also had close ties to the Adani Group, Hindenburg alleged in the report published on Saturday. “At the same time, Ahuja was a director of Adani Enterprises where he served three terms spanning nine years ending in June 2017, per his biography and exchange disclosures. Prior to that he was also the nominee director in Adani Power.”
Ahuja rejected the Hindenburg reports inferences.
“I have been at the senior most levels of international finance for three decades,” he said. “The question of being on the board of Adani Group companies and investing even a cent in them does not even arise. It’s insider trading 101. Hindenburg is clutching at the straws.”
While emphasising that at no point had IPE or Ahuja invested in any bonds, equities or derivatives of any Adani Group company, the Buch family, in a detailed statement, said, “The decision to invest in this fund was because the chief investment officer, Anil Ahuja, is Dhaval’s childhood friend from school and IIT Delhi and, being an ex-employee of Citibank, JP Morgan and 3i Group Plc, had many decades of a strong investing career. The fact that these were the drivers of the investment decision is borne out by the fact that when, in 2018, Mr. Ahuja, left his position as CIO of the fund, we redeemed the investment in that fund.”
The Adani Group in a statement to the exchanges on Sunday also said, “Anil Ahuja was a nominee director of 3i investment fund in Adani Power (2007- 2008) and, later, a director of Adani Enterprises until 2017… The Adani Group has absolutely no commercial relationship with the individuals or matters mentioned in this calculated deliberate effort to malign our standing.”
Banker, Investor
After IIM-A, both Ahuja and his wife joined Citi in the late 80s. He was in transaction services and his wife in corporate banking, rising up the ranks before she went on to join Citibank Venture Capital India (CVCI). He went on to become the officer in charge of the transaction banking vertical himself. Veterans in the organisation recall that at around the same time the Wall Street bank had started a company for software and tech services. All Citi employees, including junior and clerical staff got shares of Citicorp Information Technology Industries Ltd. (CITIL) on a preferential basis. A few years later, when the bank was under financial pressure, it transferred its shares in CITIL to CVCI at a discount “to show profits.” By then, Latika Ahuja was already in CVCI.
CITIL under CVCI became Iflex Solutions and eventually got listed. “Before the IPO, Ahuja and some other senior Citi executives had amassed a large chunk of the company’s shares buying from his colleagues at a discount who did not have any other liquidity option,” said a former Citi colleague who did not want to be identified. At one point, the Ahujas were among the single largest individual shareholders of Iflex, which was subsequently bought by Oracle in 2005. Citi’s $400,000 investment led to a bumper payout after Citi sold its 42% interest for $592 million.
“Ahuja was known for his intelligence and aggressive bets in both Citi and later in his PE stints with JP Morgan and 3i. Some worked, many didn’t,” said a former PE colleague who didn’t want to be identified.
IPE Plus Fund currently trades as 360 One Wam Ltd. On Sunday, the company said “IPE Plus Fund 1 made zero investments in any shares of the Adani Group either directly or indirectly” throughout its tenure in the six years to October 2019.

“I have been at the senior most levels of international finance for three decades,” he said. “The question of being on the board of Adani Group companies and investing even a cent in them does not even arise. It’s insider trading 101. Hindenburg is clutching at the straws.”
While emphasising that at no point had IPE or Ahuja invested in any bonds, equities or derivatives of any Adani Group company, the Buch family, in a detailed statement, said, “The decision to invest in this fund was because the chief investment officer, Anil Ahuja, is Dhaval’s childhood friend from school and IIT Delhi and, being an ex-employee of Citibank, JP Morgan and 3i Group Plc, had many decades of a strong investing career. The fact that these were the drivers of the investment decision is borne out by the fact that when, in 2018, Mr. Ahuja, left his position as CIO of the fund, we redeemed the investment in that fund.”
The Adani Group in a statement to the exchanges on Sunday also said, “Anil Ahuja was a nominee director of 3i investment fund in Adani Power (2007- 2008) and, later, a director of Adani Enterprises until 2017… The Adani Group has absolutely no commercial relationship with the individuals or matters mentioned in this calculated deliberate effort to malign our standing.”
Banker, Investor
After IIM-A, both Ahuja and his wife joined Citi in the late 80s. He was in transaction services and his wife in corporate banking, rising up the ranks before she went on to join Citibank Venture Capital India (CVCI). He went on to become the officer in charge of the transaction banking vertical himself. Veterans in the organisation recall that at around the same time the Wall Street bank had started a company for software and tech services. All Citi employees, including junior and clerical staff got shares of Citicorp Information Technology Industries Ltd. (CITIL) on a preferential basis. A few years later, when the bank was under financial pressure, it transferred its shares in CITIL to CVCI at a discount “to show profits.” By then, Latika Ahuja was already in CVCI.
CITIL under CVCI became Iflex Solutions and eventually got listed. “Before the IPO, Ahuja and some other senior Citi executives had amassed a large chunk of the company’s shares buying from his colleagues at a discount who did not have any other liquidity option,” said a former Citi colleague who did not want to be identified. At one point, the Ahujas were among the single largest individual shareholders of Iflex, which was subsequently bought by Oracle in 2005. Citi’s $400,000 investment led to a bumper payout after Citi sold its 42% interest for $592 million.
“Ahuja was known for his intelligence and aggressive bets in both Citi and later in his PE stints with JP Morgan and 3i. Some worked, many didn’t,” said a former PE colleague who didn’t want to be identified.
IPE Plus Fund currently trades as 360 One Wam Ltd. On Sunday, the company said “IPE Plus Fund 1 made zero investments in any shares of the Adani Group either directly or indirectly” throughout its tenure in the six years to October 2019.

"Ripple Begins Beta Testing of Its New Stablecoin (RLUSD) on XRPL and Ethereum
Ripple Labs has announced the initiation of beta testing for its new stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the Ethereum mainnet. This development marks a significant step in Ripple’s efforts to introduce more high-quality assets to the XRPL, aiming to enhance opportunities, liquidity, and institutional use cases for various users, developers, and applications. Additionally, Ripple USD is now available on the Ethereum mainnet, with future plans to expand its presence across other blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
Currently, Ripple USD is in its beta phase and is undergoing thorough testing by the company’s enterprise partners. Ripple emphasized the importance of this stage to ensure that the stablecoin meets the highest standards of security, efficiency, and reliability before its full launch, which is contingent upon obtaining regulatory approval. As such, Ripple USD is not yet available for purchase or trading.
Ripple also issued a warning to the public to be wary of potential crypto scams that might falsely claim to offer early access to Ripple USD. The company reiterated that the stablecoin is not available for trading or purchase at this time.
Ripple USD is designed to be a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. The stablecoin is fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents, providing a high level of trust and stability. These reserve assets will be audited by an independent third-party accounting firm, with Ripple committed to publishing monthly attestations to maintain transparency.
Ripple also mentioned in its blog post that it plans to integrate Ripple USD into its cross-border payments solution alongside XRP once the stablecoin becomes widely available. The company believes that RLUSD will enhance the global payment experience for its customers, aligning with a market projected to grow to over $2.8 trillion by 2028. Ripple is aiming to become a key player in the stablecoin market."
"NOW he wants peace: Oct. 7 mastermind and new Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar pushing cease-fire
Hamas will not participate in upcoming cease-fire talks with Israel without a promise to stop fighting, new leader claims
Hamas on Sunday said it will not participate in the planned upcoming cease-fire negotiations with Israel without a promised permanent halt to fighting.
The Palestinian terror group, now led by Oct. 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar, claimed the current talks have strayed too far from what had been backed by President Biden and the UN Security Council last month, as it called on the parties to turn back the clock.
“The movement calls on the mediators to present a plan to implement what was agreed upon by the movement on July 2, 2024, based on Biden’s vision and the UN Security Council resolution,” Hamas said in a statement.
“The mediators should enforce this on the occupation (Israel) instead of pursuing further rounds of negotiations or new proposals that would provide cover for the occupation’s aggression and grant it more time to continue its genocide against our people.”
While Hamas has claimed to be all-in on the US-backed deal, it also has repeatedly demanded that a pledged permanent end to the 10-month war be included in any pact, rather than the de-escalation called for in the July proposal.
The US-backed deal had called for an immediate halt to the fighting in Gaza as for Hamas and Israel set the groundwork for a hostage exchange that would see the remaining 120 captives free.
It also called for discussions to be held on the future of Gaza without Hamas in charge.
Meanwhile, Israel has repeatedly stated that the fighting must continue until the Iran-backed terror group is destroyed.
The Jewish state is retaliating for the terrorists’ Oct. 7 massacre in Israel that killed more than 1,200 people.
It remains unclear how committed Hamas is to a cease-fire as its new leader, Sinwar, has previously sabotaged previous peace talks and called on the terror group to continue the war until Israel is destroyed.
Hours before Hamas issued its statement, sources familiar with the cease-fire talks told CNN that Sinwar was now asking Egyptian and Qatari mediators to help push for an end to the fighting.
As for hardliner Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he is facing growing pressure to accept a cease-fire deal and end the 10-month war, with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, the main group advocating with the families of those kidnapped by Hamas, pushing for an immediate pact.
”A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home. Time is running out,” the group recently said in a recent statement.
“The hostages have no more to spare. A deal must be signed now,” it added.
Despite being adamantly against a cease-fire deal that would end the war but allow Hamas to remain in Gaza, Netanyahu is seen as being as ready as he’ll ever be to make a deal, sources said.
But nothing is set in stone, they said.
“Nobody knows what Bibi wants,” an Israeli source told CNN of the prime minister.
While Netanyahu is facing backlash over the war, he is also facing pressure from his own coalition partners to stick to the offensive.
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich slammed the current US-backed cease-fire push as a “surrender,” urging Netanyahu not to falter.
“I call on the prime minister not to fall into this trap,” Smotrich said Friday."
"Historic shift: Attorney-General uses significant economic pressure to enforce haredi draft
In the long struggle to get haredim to serve in the army, Sunday, August 11, may very well go down as a watershed date.
For on Sunday, the attorney-general started to use the heavy economic tools at the state’s disposal to get haredi yeshiva and kollel students into the army: imposing financial sanctions on the draft evaders themselves, not only on their yeshivot.
Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara’s office sent a letter ordering the Labor Minister, Yoav Ben-Tzur from Shas, to cut childcare subsidies worth between NIS 1,000 to NIS 1,700 per child to yeshiva students who are ignoring call-up notices.
The letter, signed by Deputy Attorney-General Gil Limon, stated that following a June High Court ruling that mandated the drafting of yeshiva students due to the absence of a legislative framework from the Knesset, the state no longer has the authority to provide childcare subsidies for children up to age three of kollel students designated for military service but who have not responded to draft notices. >This affects haredim aged 18-26 who have not shown up to be drafted.
Last week, only some 5% of the haredim who were sent their first call-up notice—or some 50 men—showed up at the country’s induction centers on the two days set aside for haredim.
Dozens of other haredim, however, showed up at the centers to protest and, at one point, broke into a base, shouting slogans such as ""We would rather die than serve.""
The IDF is planning to send out draft notices to some 3,000 haredim in the coming weeks, and those who don’t show up for this initial screening and evaluation process will be considered deserters and, if Baharav-Miara’s order goes into effect, will risk losing the daycare subsidies.
The new arrangement is to go into effect when the new year starts on September 1, though the attorney-general indicated there may be some wiggle room to allow for parents to make the necessary adjustments.
In late June, the High Court of Justice issued a landmark ruling saying there was no longer a legal basis for the continued military exemption for yeshiva students and ordered that the government stop funding yeshivot housing students who do not serve.
This ruling signified a dramatic shift in direction regarding this issue that has bedeviled the country since its founding. That ruling said that educational institutions harboring students who do not serve in violation of the law should be penalized by losing state funding. The court, however, did not go the extra mile and say the financial sanctions should be extended to the individual yeshiva students themselves for not showing up for army service.
That is the step the attorney general took on Sunday.
Why economic sanctions aren't the most effective
Economic sanctions against the yeshivot are a stick, but not the heaviest one that the country can wield. For instance, married Kollel students are not living off the NIS 855 stipend they get from the yeshivot. Rather, they receive all kinds of other state subsidies that allow them to study rather than work, with the childcare subsidy being one of the most significant.
According to various estimates, the state allocates between NIS 160 million to NIS 200 million a year for childcare subsidies to haredi families where the husband, aged 18-26, does not go into the army.
For a family with four children, this subsidy is worth between NIS 4,400 to 6,800 a month, a much more significant sum in trying to balance a household budget than the NIS 855 stipend coming from the yeshivot.
This, therefore, explains the furious reaction from haredi politicians.
Shas issued a statement saying that the move is “cruel legal bullying and abuse of helpless children.” Jerusalem and Heritage Minister Meir Porush of UTJ picked up on this theme that the move is abusing children, saying, “The legal system drags small children into a political battle and works to starve them.”
It’s interesting that they chose to focus their criticisms on the how unfair this is to children. A similar argument could come from the opposite direction, with reservists arguing that it is unfair -- because of a lack of manpower in the army -- that their children will be without their fathers for months on end this year.
Baharav-Miara’s letter was not the first time that there had been moves to cut childcare subsidies to full-time Kollel students.
In July 2021, soon after Avigdor Liberman took over as Finance Minister in Naftali Bennett’s government, he announced that he would be cutting childcare stipends to families where the husband was a full-time Kollel student. This was part of a broader effort to encourage greater workforce participation among haredim and prioritize subsidies for those who work and pay taxes.
Like Baharav-Miara, Liberman was roundly slammed by the haredi parties, who argued that his aim was to uproot their way of life.
As is the case now, Liberman’s decree came just weeks before the start of the new school year, and an appeal was taken to the High Court of Justice, which ruled in January 2022 that implementation would have to wait until the following year to allow the parents to make alternative arrangements.
The court ruled that not allowing a year’s grace period before cutting the subsidies did not “strike an appropriate and informed balance between the relevant interests under the circumstances, and is therefore unreasonable.”
In the meantime, the government collapsed, the country went to yet another round of elections, and a new government was formed headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the inclusion of the Haredi parties, and the policy was never implemented.
Both Liberman and Baharav-Miara’s moves are steeped in the belief that in order to change long-rooted behavioral patterns, economic sanctions are needed.
Ironically, Netanyahu pioneered this approach when he served as Finance Minister in Ariel Sharon’s government from 2002 to 2005.
During that period, Netanyahu implemented an austerity program that cut social services spending and allowances to reduce the government deficit and stimulate private sector growth. A key part of that plan was to slash child allowance payments, a move that had a huge impact on haredi families since many of these families were largely dependent on these allowances to financially make it through the month.
The loss of this income convinced many in the haredi community of the need to work. Haredi employment rates, which were 37% for men and 51% for women in 2003, rose to 55% for men and 81% for women by 2023. The child allowance cuts did not lead to any overnight transformational change but rather to a steady incremental change that spurred much greater haredi participation in the workforce.
Baharav-Miara’s action regarding the childcare subsidies will undoubtedly be challenged in the court. If the court upholds the ruling, though perhaps mandating a greater leeway period than the three weeks before September 1, the country may see that this move will -- because of economic necessity -- trigger greater haredi participation in the army, just as the slashing of child-allowances two decades ago led to significantly greater haredi participation in the workforce today."

"Jeffrey Epstein’s Infamous ‘Little Black Book’ Hits Auction Block: ‘Criminal Relic’ Holds Entries for 386 Power Players — Including Personal Numbers for Donald Trump and Robert F Kennedy Jr!
Jeffrey Epstein’s Infamous ‘Little Black Book’ Hits Auction Block: ‘Criminal Relic’ Holds Entries for 386 Power Players — Including Personal Numbers for Donald Trump and Robert F Kennedy Jr!
Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous address book – featuring the personal numbers of Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – is set to be auctioned to the highest bidder.
The Maryland-based auction house, Alexander Historical Auctions, known for selling historic letters and documents, announced on Friday, August 9, it will accept sealed bids on Epstein’s “little black book” from May 15 to June 15 on their website.
Auctioneer Bill Panagopulos said: “The small, plastic-bound 64-page book contains 386 individual printed entries with two handwritten entries penned on the last page. The book was earlier offered for private sale only and drew offers in the area of $100,000.”
The owner of the “criminal relic” reportedly rejected the offers, insisting that he was more concerned about the book being used for research purposes, specifically to uncover Epstein’s purported ties to foreign intelligence services or governments.
If the auction house doesn’t receive a satisfactory bid, the item will be sold at a public auction in mid-July.
Most entries in the black book include contact information for private residences, aides, employees, parents, and even girlfriends. Many numbers have no names indicated at all.
Ninety-four names bear black checkmarks, and five have been highlighted in yellow. These five names, including former President Trump, are well-recognized financial and industrial figureheads.
In addition to the ex-prez, the book includes current independent presidential candidate RFK Jr., attorney Alan Dershowitz, Sen. Edward Kennedy, and many others in the world of politics, film, finance, fashion, manufacturing, real estate and law.

Epstein's book was reportedly found on a Fifth Ave. sidewalk in New York in the mid-1990s and later sold in the Northeast.
Business Insider submitted the book for forensic analysis, which confirmed the book belonged to the infamous pedophile and human trafficker.
Dozens of the names listed in the book were contacted and informed that their numbers had been exposed. Some spoke candidly of their relationship with Epstein, while others denied it or simply hung up.
Have a tip? Send it to us! Email RadarOnline.com at tips@radaronline.com.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, a plethora of never-before-seen pornographic photos and videos secretly stashed away by Epstein was recently uncovered by his estate.
The explosive discovery emerged in federal court documents filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands and an unidentified victim accusing JP Morgan Chase bank of turning a blind eye to Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking operation and the secret payments he made to reported victims through wire and cash transactions.
The new evidence may also spark a new Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation."
"Hindenburg row: Left parties demand JPC probe
NEW DELHI, Aug 11: Left parties on Sunday demanded that a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) should be constituted to probe the allegations levelled by US short-seller Hindenburg Research against SEBI chairperson Madhabi Buch.
In a statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said the Hindenburg Research, which had earlier exposed the stock price manipulation by the Adani group of companies, has now levelled serious charges against Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairperson Madhabi Buch and her husband.
The party said the Hindenburg report has cited documents to show that Buch and her husband held stakes in the same offshore funds which were utilized by Vinod Adani to invest in Adani companies.
“Given these serious charges against the head of the regulatory authority, it is necessary that the Chairperson step aside till a proper investigation is conducted,” the CPI(M) said.
“The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) reiterates its demand that the entire affair of the stock market manipulation of shares of the Adani group be probed by setting up a Joint Parliamentary Committee,” it said.
CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, in a post on X, said, “The latest Hindenburg revelations have accused the regulator, SEBI, and that its chairperson herself is part of the manipulation. She must immediately quit and a Joint Parliamentary Committee to be constituted for the investigation.”
CPI general secretary D Raja said whether a JPC is constituted or not, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should speak on the issue.
“Hindenburg revelation has thoroughly exposed the BJP government headed by Mr Modi. How Mr Modi and his government are backing the corporate houses, particularly Adani’s, to loot the wealth of the nation,” Raja said.
“SEBI is considered to be a market regulator. But SEBI chief has conflict of interest… It is a very serious moral question whether she can continue to be chief. She has to think over,” he said.
“As far as our party is concerned, she has to step down… Then what is the response of government?” he said.
“There is a need for high level appropriate investigation. Some people have demanded already JPC. Whether there is JPC or not, the situation cannot be allowed to continue like this. And Finance Minister, Prime Minister should spell out what they are going to do with this situation,” Raja said.
CPI(M) leader Hannan Mollah called it an “old story”, and alleged that the SEBI did not probe the earlier allegations properly.
“You know this is an old story. When first this issue was exposed, the whole country was shattered as how the share market manipulation is helping Modi’s very close friend Adani and family, and they are engaged in manipulation of shares. At that time government was ‘hell-bent’ to defend the Adani family, that it’s false, report is not correct,” Mollah said.
He said the Supreme Court put faith in SEBI.
“But now it’s exposed that SEBI chairperson has some complicity with that…SEBI did not enquire properly because of SEBI chairperson’s complicity… Now government or SEBI cannot bring out the truth, it’s very clear. I think only Joint Parliamentary Committee can enquire properly,” he said.
Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya also demanded a JPC probe.
“Hindenburg report now shows involvement of SEBI chairperson in Adani shares. SEBI clearly cannot be expected to probe Adani group’s monumental corporate fraud. SEBI chairperson must be removed and the Adani probe handed over to a Joint Parliamentary Committee,” he said.
On similar lines, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Manoj Jha said it shows the level of corruption.
“This shows how our financial systems have been hijacked. This is the level of corruption and there are attempts to cover it up. You complain to SEBI about financial mismanagement, and now SEBI is tainted,” he said.
He backed the demand for a JPC probe.
“Our systems have been rigged and rigged very badly,” he said.
US short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that it suspects SEBI’s unwillingness to act against Adani group may be because of its head Madhabi Puri Buch had stakes in offshore funds linked to the conglomerate, an allegation slammed by the SEBI head as “baseless” while Adani group said it never had any commercial relations with Buch.
Hindenburg alleged that Buch and her husband had undisclosed investments in obscure offshore funds in Bermuda and Mauritius, the same entities allegedly used by Vinod Adani, the elder brother of group chairman Gautam Adani, to round-trip funds and inflate stock prices. (PTI)"
"Delhi HC seeks govt, L-G response to BJP MLA’s plea for implementation of 6th Finance Commission
Delhi HC seeks govt, L-G response to BJP MLA’s plea for implementation of 6th Finance Commission
The petition was moved by BJP’s Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta. The court also issued notice to the Union Government, through the Ministry of Home Affairs.
The Delhi High Court Monday issued notice to the Delhi government and the L-G on a petition seeking the court’s direction to immediately constitute and implement the Sixth Delhi Finance Commission’s (DFC) recommendations, pointing out that it has been due since April 2021 and is hampering the Municipal Corporation of Delhi’s functioning due to lack of funds.
The petition was moved by BJP’s Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta. The court also issued notice to the Union Government, through the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Gupta, in his petition, highlighted that as per the DMC (Amendment) Act, 2022, passed by Parliament, the three municipal corporations — East, North and South — were unified into a single entity on May 22, 2022, as the “Municipal Corporation of Delhi” and all employees of these three corporations became employees of the MCD, “thereby presenting a fresh set challenges and issues to deal with”.
According to Gupta, “There is an increased need for the 6th DFC recommendations to be tabled since the 5th Finance Commission is not applicable anymore owing to changes in circumstances that have made it obsolete”. He said the Delhi government continues to provide funds to MCD based on the 5th DFC recommendations, “which are highly insufficient”, and this is causing “undue hardship to the Municipal Corporation due to lack of funds”.
Even as the court of Justice Sanjeev Barula sought a response from the government authorities, Gupta submitted in his petition that the lack of funds is “adversely affecting the civic life of nearly 97% of Delhi’s population,” and the MCD is struggling to pay salaries to its employees.
Notably, in multiple litigations, including PILs that have been taken up for hearing before the bench led by Acting Chief Justice Manmohan of late, the MCD has been rapped for lacking sufficient funds.
Gupta went on to submit that the GNCTD “has failed in its duty to constitute the Sixth Delhi Finance Commission despite it being due since April 2021 i.e. end of the term of the 5th Finance Commission (valid until March 2021), thereby depriving the Municipal Corporation of NCT of Delhi in its share in the finances of the state”.
Gupta also sought the court’s direction to the L-G to call for a special Delhi Assembly session so that the 6th DFC report can be tabled at the earliest.

"BJP frames Hindenburg report as ‘part of attack on Indian institutions’, likely to stay silent on SEBI chief
BJP frames Hindenburg report as ‘part of attack on Indian institutions’, likely to stay silent on SEBI chief
“The concerned person as well as regulator have made their statements, nothing further to be added by govt,” says Finance Ministry; BJP accuses Cong of “seeking foreign help to discredit financial markets and create chaos”
Seeking to counter allegations by US-based Hindenburg Research regarding the SEBI Chairperson and Adani Group, the BJP will continue to project the same as part of “repeated attacks on independent institutions in the country”, deliberately hurting the government’s credibility and India’s investment prospects.
On Monday, at a press conference held at its headquarters, the BJP slammed the Congress demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into Hindenburg’s allegations against SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch, accusing it of “seeking foreign help to discredit (and) destabilise our financial markets and to create chaos in the country… by spreading anarchy on a fictitious report”.
Senior party leader and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: “Any Tom, Dick and Harry sitting in a foreign country will seek to destabilise India and they (the Congress) will say ‘JPC’. They will belittle India’s investors. They will belittle India’s stock market. That is their game. The JPC demand is a sham.”
In its first official reaction to the allegations, the Union Ministry of Finance said it had nothing to add after the SEBI and Buch had issued their statements. Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth told reporters: “The SEBI has given a statement. The concerned person has given a statement. I have nothing further to add.”
Seth, as the Department of Economic Affairs Secretary, is a part-time member on the SEBI board. When asked whether Buch would step aside, Seth reiterated, “Both of them, the concerned person as well as the regulator, have made their statements and there is nothing further to be added by the government.”
A detailed questionnaire sent by The Indian Express to Seth did not elicit a response.
On the question of Buch personally, BJP leaders, however, did not disagree that she should step down in the wake of “such serious allegations”. At least three senior BJP leaders as well as two leaders among allies TDP and JD(U) that The Indian Express spoke with, said it would be better if Buch steps down immediately. However, one of them admitted that there was no signal from the BJP top leadership of her resignation being sought.
A BJP office-bearer indicated that this would remain the party’s stand. “Buch has to defend herself and the SEBI has to do the damage control. The BJP does not need to react to her alleged links with any business groups.”
Instead, the party will keep up its counter-attack, questioning “the intentions” of such allegations by “external forces” and the Congress role in it. An NDA leader said: “Ideally, the SEBI chief should step down. But what is most dangerous is how India’s image has taken a hit in terms of the credibility of its institutions.”
Prasad said at the press conference: “After being rebuffed by the people of India, the Congress party, its allies and the toolkit gang have conspired together to usher in economic anarchy and instability in India… The Hindenburg report is released on Saturday, there is uproar on Sunday, so the capital market is destabilised on Monday.”
Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s “pathological hatred for Prime Minister Narendra Modi” had caused the Congress “to develop hatred for India”, Prasad said, adding that global advocacy funder George Soros, “who regularly runs propaganda against India”, is the main investor in Hindenburg.
Prasad also said that the SEBI had sent a notice to the US-based Hindenburg as part of its probe into the firm’s allegations of stock market manipulation against the Adani Group and that, instead of replying, Hindenburg had chosen to target Buch.
Senior BJP leader and former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said: “It is terribly disconcerting and irresponsible that Rahul Gandhi-led Opposition has been, as a pattern, constantly undermining important institutions, the judiciary first, then the Election Commission, the Electronic Voting Machines and the democratic process, the RBI and so many others, including the SEBI. This could destabilise the perception of Indian and financial markets globally, especially at a time when India’s economy is growing fast. We will not permit them to do it.”
BJP’s alliance partner TDP also talked about the “perception” such allegations could create. TDP parliamentary party leader Lavu Srikrishna Devarayalu told The Indian Express: “Since the first allegations came out (by Hindenburg), enough scrutiny has been done and all the facts are available… The Opposition keeps talking about creating jobs, but what kind of narrative are they creating even about the Budget, which intends to create jobs?”
Devarayalu said that the Opposition’s claims that the Modi government would not last was part of the same “narrative”. “In the past, the Congress has formed coalition governments. Why does it think that the BJP-led NDA would not be stable?”
On Saturday, Hindenburg Research alleged that Buch and her husband had stakes in obscure offshore funds, which it claims were used to siphon off money by the Adani Group.
The SEBI came out in Buch’s defence Sunday, saying they had adequate internal mechanisms to address issues related to conflict of interest. “The Chairperson has also recused herself in matters involving potential conflicts of interest,” the regulator said.
The report by Hindenburg Research comes almost 18 months after the short-seller first kicked up a political storm, accusing the Adani Group of “brazen stock market manipulation” and “accounting fraud” in January 2023. The port-to-energy conglomerate had denied the allegations, and the Supreme Court had rejected the demand for a CBI or court-monitored probe.
A senior BJP leader said the fallout of the current “revelations” is less than what happened in January 2023. “It is less damaging to the credibility of the government,” he said.

TV chef picks best cheap eats in London
Every Wednesday we ask top chefs to pick their favourite Cheap Eats where they live and when they cook at home. This week we speak to TV chef Judy Joo, who co-owns the popular Seoul Bird in London.
Hi Judy, can you tell us your favourite places in London where you can get a meal for two for less than £40?
Since 1900, Paul Rothe & Son in Marylebone has been crafting some of the best sandwiches in London. Lucky for me, I live just around the corner from this charming, historic deli.
My go-to is their famous pastrami and cheese, piled high with pickle, mayo, and mustard. Occasionally, I'll switch things up with their epic coronation chicken, or if I'm feeling adventurous, a jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn. It's quintessentially British, and I love it.
Trejo's Tacos has crossed the pond, opening its first international outpost in Notting Hill. Founded by actor Danny Trejo, this canteen boasts a cult following in Los Angeles (myself included) and has quickly become my favourite spot for tacos in London.
My usual order includes a plate of Baja fish and spicy shrimp tacos, dosed in their house hot sauce and perfectly complemented by one of their stellar OG margaritas or homemade horchata. I also love their house-made guacamole and salsa served with their truly addictive freshly fried corn tortilla chips. I just munch away while thinking of the southern California sun.
I live near Edgware Road, an area renowned for its vibrant Middle Eastern community and fantastic cuisine. Maroush, a London institution with multiple venues across the city, remains a favourite, especially the original one on Edgware Road.
The chicken or lamb shawarma is the star dish, slow-cooked on vertical rotisseries, infused with aromatic spices, and expertly sliced off with sabers. It's the perfect late-night snack after a few too many pints. I love their tomato okra stew with rice - so comforting and warming.
Tucked away in the basement of an unassuming British pub down a quaint mews street in Marylebone is Liu Xiaomian.
I usually order the minced pork xiaomian - toothsome wheat noodles swimming in a red chilli broth, then dressed with seasoned pork and fragrant spring onions. The numbing pork wontons are another standout, delivering what their name promises in true mala style. Don't miss the cucumber side salad which offers a refreshing respite for your palate.
What is your go-to cheap eat to cook at home when you have a night in?
My go-to budget-friendly meal for cooking at home is pimped-out instant ramen noodles.
If I am feeling spicy, I'll grab a pack of Shin Ramen and add fresh veggies and leftover proteins from the fridge.
Spinach, mushrooms, corn, spring onions, leftover roasted chicken, and some frozen dumplings usually make their way into the pot. Absolutely anything goes!
And, to finish, I'll crack an egg in and let it cook on top of the noodles just until the yolk is set, but still gooey. It's a quick, delicious meal that hits the spot every time.

"Legacy of Antonio Delfim Netto: Architect of Brazil’s Economic Miracle
Legacy of Antonio Delfim Netto: Architect of Brazil’s Economic Miracle
Antonio Delfim Netto, a key economic figure in Brazil during the military rule of the 1970s and 1980s, died at age 96. As finance minister, he presided over a period of rapid economic growth, known as Brazil's 'economic miracle.' Delfim Netto continued to influence economic policy even after the return to civilian rule.
Antonio Delfim Netto, one of Brazil's most prominent economists and economic masterminds during the military government in the 1970s and 1980s, passed away on Monday at the age of 96.
According to his office, Delfim Netto died after spending a week in the hospital due to health complications. He was Brazil's finance minister from 1967 to 1974 and later served as planning minister from 1979 to 1985 during the era of military rule.
After the restoration of civilian governance in 1985, Delfim Netto was elected to Congress five times and remained influential in both economic and political realms, frequently sharing his insights through newspaper columns. He also advised leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during his first two terms and supported him in the 2022 elections.
As finance minister, Delfim Netto oversaw a period of rapid economic growth, termed the Brazilian 'economic miracle,' achieving a record GDP growth of 14.4% in 1974. Later, as planning minister, he navigated the country through a global financial crisis precipitated by oil price shocks and high U.S. interest rates.
In 2012, Delfim Netto donated his extensive collection of over 250,000 books to the University of Sao Paulo. Born in 1928 in Sao Paulo's working-class Cambuci neighborhood, he rose from modest beginnings, with his mother a seamstress and his father a municipal transport employee.

"Council writes off millions in unpaid debt, finance report reveals
City of Wolverhampton Council wrote off more than £2m in uncollected debt from the last financial year. The figure was revealed in a budget monitoring report presented to the council’s cabinet for approval at its meeting in July.
The debts come from a variety of sources with unpaid council tax contributing the most unrecoverable income. Cllr Louise Miles, Wolverhampton cabinet member for resources, said: “Debt write off is against rigorous criteria and is not done lightly.
“The kind of criteria we use where we are unable to trace the person concerned.” The report says 1,450 council tax debts worth ££823,330 were written off in the year ending March 2024 with the worst cases requiring approval from the cabinet.

The highest single figure to be chalked off was £9,326 where the debtor could not be traced. The next largest pot of missing cash was non-domestic rates which came in at £610,600 with the biggest single unpaid bill standing at £50,202.
Collection of the largest amount was prohibited by law – which means the council has run out of time to take certain types of action to recover the debt. The council cancelled 235 debts where services were provided to individuals and businesses but money was not collected.
These ‘sundry debts’ clocked up to £445,053, out of that total £16,300 was written off because debtors were deceased and there was no estate to claim from. Unpaid council rent accounted for £242,989 of unrecoverable debt with the largest single amount given as £6,334 where the debtor was unable to manage their own affairs.
The report says: “Debts are only written off as a last resort, when all feasible recovery action has been exhausted. “If the situation surrounding an individual case changes in the future, steps would be taken to pursue the debt, despite the debt having been written off.”

"Gustavo Franco: Brasil é exemplo mundial em dinheiro digital
O Brasil tem tido um bom desempenho na agenda de moeda digital, se destacando como modelo para outros países, mas, na questão da regulação, precisa visitar o que foi estudado e implementado no passado para encontrar os rumos mais acertados para o futuro. A avaliação é do ex-presidente do Banco Central e sócio fundador da Rio Bravo Investimentos, Gustavo Franco.
“O Brasil é exemplo mundial em lidar bem com o dinheiro digital, com digitalização privada, e todos esses outros temas, que todo mundo está tropeçando nesse assunto, e nós estamos indo muito bem. Melhor do que todo mundo. É muito difícil uma medalha de ouro, mas eu acho que já está perto disso nesse tema”, declarou Franco, durante participação no evento sobre regulação financeira Finance of Tomorrow, no Rio de Janeiro.
“O passado do dinheiro ensina muito sobre o seu futuro”, mencionou Franco.
Pedro Malan
Também presente ao debate, o ex-ministro da Fazenda e ex-presidente do BC Pedro Malan disse estar “fascinado” com a velocidade das transformações no sistema financeiro, a partir da incorporação de inovações tecnológicas.
“Eu vejo o que está acontecendo no mundo cripto, virou um outro mundo, sujeito a todo tipo de coisa, inclusive legais e ilegais”, disse Malan, lembrando questões de falha de segurança. “Eu vejo com uma enorme preocupação essa vertiginosa mudança, espero que alguém esteja entendendo”, brincou.
Embora se preocupe com a segurança e as consequências das mudanças aceleradas, o economista disse que soluções devem ser estudadas e buscadas pelas novas gerações.
“Eu sou um velhinho”, sugeriu um bem-humorado Malan. “A minha geração está passando a tocha para as novas gerações, é como se fosse uma corrida de revezamento, né? Agora é com vocês, jovens. Boa sorte.”

"E-Commerce Growth Lifted This Tech Giant's Earnings, and Its Stock Jumped 12%
Key Takeaways
- A 40% jump in sales for Singapore's Shopee helped its parent Sea Limited post strong earnings.
- CEO Forrest Li said Shopee will become adjusted EBITDA-positive starting in the third quarter.
- Sea's gaming and financial services businesses also saw double-digit growth.
- The company's U.S.-traded shares jumped 12% on Tuesday, boosting its year-to-date gain to 85%.
Shares of Sea Limited (SE), the Singapore tech conglomerate that runs online shopping website Shopee, soared Tuesday after the company reported double-digit revenue growth in all its business segments for the second quarter.
Sea posted second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, with revenue up 23.0% to $3.8 billion. Both exceeded estimates.
The biggest driver of revenue growth was e-commerce sales that soared 40% to $2.5 billion. Shopee has a significant presence in South Asia, Taiwan and Latin America.
CEO Forrest Li said because of its strong first half results, Sea expects Shopee's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to be positive starting in the third quarter. The company is also is raising its full-year outlook for gross merchandise value (GMV) to mid-20% growth.
Gaming, Financial Units Also Show Strong Growth
Sea also owns Garena, the gaming business behind popular game Free Fire and other digital entertainment such as publishing and e-sports. SeaMoney, is the company's digital finance subsidiary offering mobile wallets and process payments in Southeast Asia and Brazil.
Digital financial revenue increased 21.4% to $519.3 million, while digital entertainment revenue climbed 21.1% to $536.8 million.
""Garena delivered a strong quarter, with more than 20% year-on-year growth in bookings, mainly contributed by Free Fire,"" said Mr. Li, adding that the game had more than 100 million active players.
Sea Limited's American Depositary Shares rose 11.9% to finish Tuesday's session at $74.85. The stock has risen 85% since the beginning of the year."
"DLT to investigate Chinese transport sector 'dominance'
The Department of Land Transport (DLT) on Tuesday played down media reports of Chinese companies increasingly dominating the domestic transport sector through takeovers of struggling Thai transport businesses, saying licences granted to one business could not be transferred to another even in a takeover.
""More importantly, only Thai legal entities registered and headquartered in Thailand are eligible to hold the licences,"" the department's statement continued.
The department said that at least 51% of a business's shareholders must be Thai for it to operate legally.
Next week, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance will discuss concerns that Thai citizens are being paid to hold shares to skirt this rule.
They would work together to find better measures to regulate these foreign companies in disguise and ensure they cannot gain any advantages over local Thai business operators, said the DLT release.
As for the many Chinese lorries now seen operating in Thailand, the department said vehicles from any country are currently allowed to be used in Thailand as long as they are legally imported and meet the other related requirements in case they are to be used in the transport sector.
At present, over 8,400 vehicles produced in China are registered for use in the transport sector in Thailand, many of which were assembled by a Chinese car maker with a production base in Thailand, said the department.
Aside from all the Thai laws, the DLT said it is also committed to following the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the six countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including Thailand, in 2016 on the Early Harvest Implementation of the Cross-Border Transport Facilitation Agreement (CBTA), which has been extended to Dec 31, 2026.
The department also said this agreement benefits Thai transport operators.
Up until now, 11 Thai companies have applied for a licence to operate a total of 458 trucks under this regional agreement, and they now expect to begin operating on Sept 1.
On Saturday, a source in the private passenger transport sector said many Chinese companies were negotiating to take over more Thai passenger transport businesses.
Now that about half of the Thai operators have gone out of business, these Chinese operators are eager to enter a market where they see introducing more electric vehicles as just one of a raft of measures that would return the sector to profitability, said the source."

"From Bitcoin to Solana: Canadian Crypto Investment Firm Cypherpunk’s New Direction Explained by CEO Leah Wald
Cypherpunk Holdings is a Canadian investment firm with a strong focus on the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. The company specializes in identifying and investing in innovative blockchain technologies, companies, and emerging protocols within the digital asset space. Cypherpunk Holdings operates as a strategic holding company, allocating capital to projects that contribute to the growth and adoption of decentralized systems.
Leah Wald, who became CEO in 2024, has brought extensive experience from her previous role as the co-founder and CEO of Valkyrie Investments. At Valkyrie, she played a key role in launching one of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs listed on NASDAQ. Under her leadership, Cypherpunk Holdings is exploring new opportunities, including investments in blockchain development and staking, with a particular interest in assets like Solana (SOL). Wald places significant emphasis on keeping the company aligned with evolving regulatory frameworks, especially in the United States and Canada, which are crucial for the company’s strategic planning and the broader digital asset market.
In a recent interview on Bloomberg TV with Katie Greifeld and Tim Stenovec on August 13, the CEO of the Toronto-based crypto investment company provided insightful commentary on the company’s evolving strategy, particularly its increasing focus on Solana, while also touching on the broader cryptocurrency market, including the future of crypto ETFs.
Wald began by acknowledging that while Cypherpunk has been known primarily as a Bitcoin holding company—akin to MicroStrategy—there has been a noticeable pivot towards Solana. She emphasized that the Solana ecosystem has shown significant development, both in terms of infrastructure and community engagement. This growth, she believes, is critical for the long-term sustainability of the Solana token and its blockchain. Wald pointed out that the company’s strategy is not just about holding Solana but actively participating in its ecosystem, particularly through staking operations.
When questioned about the potential shift in asset allocation, Wald confirmed that Cypherpunk is indeed adjusting its strategy. The company is reducing its Bitcoin exposure while increasing its stake in Solana. Although she did not provide specific details on the target asset allocation, Wald made it clear that this strategic shift reflects their growing interest in the Solana ecosystem and its long-term potential.
The interview also touched on the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. Wald acknowledged that the market conditions have been intriguing, with muted demand from traditional institutional investors over the summer. She said that this has likely led to a shakeout among potential seed providers for Bitcoin ETFs, influenced by the volatility and risk parameters set by investment committees.
Despite the volatility, Wald indicated that Cypherpunk sees these market conditions as opportunities to refine its strategy, particularly as it navigates the complexities of the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.
Wald also addressed a critical question: why should investors choose Cypherpunk over directly investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF? She explained that while Cypherpunk initially offered a straightforward exposure to Bitcoin, the company has since evolved. Today, it is focused on holding and staking Solana, as well as becoming an active player in the Solana infrastructure. She said that Cypherpunk presents a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to Solana before spot Solana ETFs become available.
The conversation inevitably turned to the upcoming U.S. presidential election and its implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Wald acknowledged the challenges the industry has faced over the past four years, particularly in navigating regulatory hurdles under the current administration. However, she expressed optimism that regardless of the election outcome, the next administration would provide clearer and more supportive guidance for the cryptocurrency industry.
Wald highlighted that the industry is at a critical juncture, with traditional finance players increasingly entering the market and contributing to the educational efforts around cryptocurrency. She remains positive that this growing momentum will lead to a more favorable regulatory environment, which is essential for the industry’s continued growth.

"CBA shares on watch after FY24 earnings and dividends beat expectations
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) shares will be in focus on Wednesday after the banking giant released its full year results.
Let's see how the bank performed during FY 2024.
CBA shares on watch following strong results
- Operating income flat at $27,174 million
- Operating expenses up 3% to $12,218 million
- Pre-provisioning profit down 2% to $14,956 million
- Cash net profit after tax down 2% to $9,836 million
- Net interest margin (NIM) down 8 basis points to 1.99%
- Final dividend of $2.50 per share (FY 2024 dividend up 3% to $4.65)
What happened during the 12 months?
For the 12 months ended 30 June, CBA reported operating income of $27,174 million, which was flat on the prior corresponding period.
This reflects a small decline in income from its retail banking and New Zealand operations, which offset income growth from its business and institutional operations.
CBA's key Retail Banking division posted a 3% decline in income to $12,790 million due to lower margins from competition and unfavourable deposit mix, partly offset by volume growth. Whereas its New Zealand division reported a 5% decline in income for similar reasons.
The star of the show was CBA's Business Banking division, which posted a 4% increase in income to $8,573 million. This reflects volume growth, which was partly offset by lower margins due to competition.
It was a similar story for its Institutional Banking division, which posted a 3% lift in income to $2,506 million. This reflects higher deposits income, higher equity earnings, and favourable asset mix, which was partly offset by lower lending and leasing margins.
Higher costs, lower profits
CBA's operating expenses increased 3% in FY 2024 due to higher inflation impacting staff costs, additional technology spend to support the delivery of strategic priorities, and lower one-off items.
This ultimately led to Australia's largest bank posting a 2% decline in cash net profit after tax to $9,836 million.
Nevertheless, this profit decline didn't stop the bank's board from declaring a fully franked final dividend of $2.50 per share. This brought its total dividends to $4.65 per share, which represents a 3% increase on last year's payout.
Management notes that this increase has been supported by its share buyback. It points out that the lower share count from the ~$9.3 billion of buybacks completed since FY 2022 has contributed an additional ~26 cents to its FY 2024 dividend per share at the current payout ratio.
What else should you know?
Other key metrics of note are its NIM and credit quality.
In respect to its NIM, this was down 8 basis points to 1.99% in FY 2024. The company notes that this was largely due to the impact of competition and deposit switching, partly offset by higher earnings on replicating portfolio and equity hedges. Pleasingly, its NIM stabilised during the second half of the year and increased 1 basis point half on half.
CBA advised that its loan impairment expense decreased 28% year on year in FY 2024. This reflects its robust credit origination and underwriting practices, rising house prices, and lower expected losses within consumer finance.
However, consumer arrears increased due to the impact of higher interest rates and cost of living pressures on some borrowers. Nevertheless, its home lending portfolio remains well-secured and the majority of home lending customers remain in advance of scheduled repayments.
Provision coverage remains strong at 1.66% of credit risk weighted assets and it maintains a ~$2 billion buffer relative to the losses expected under its central economic scenario.
How does this compare to expectations?
The good news for CBA shares and its shareholders today is that this result appears to be ahead of the market's expectations.
For example, Goldman Sachs was expecting the bank to report a 3.5% decline in cash earnings from continued operations to $9,716 million. Whereas the consensus estimate was $9,783 million.
CBA's cash net profit after tax was only down 2% to $9,836 million.
In addition, the market was forecasting a final dividend of $2.40 per share, whereas CBA declared a $2.50 per share dividend.
Management commentary
CBA CEO Matt Comyn was pleased with the bank's performance. He said:
Our results demonstrate our continued focus on supporting our customers, our disciplined operational and strategic execution, and the strength of our balance sheet.
We have retained strong loan loss provision coverage, with surplus capital and conservative funding metrics. Our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet settings positions us with flexibility and capacity for a range of economic scenarios, while continuing to deliver sustainable returns.
We have declared a final dividend of $2.50 per share, fully franked, resulting in a full year dividend of $4.65.
And commenting on the bank's outlook, Comyn said:
The Australian economy remains resilient with low unemployment, continued private and public investment, and exports supporting national income. Higher interest rates are slowing the economy and gradually moderating inflation.
Australia remains well positioned but downside risks continue around productivity, housing affordability, as well as ongoing global uncertainty. We will play our part in stimulating economic growth by lending to productive parts of the economy.
We will also continue to invest in our franchise to bring our purpose to life, building a brighter future for all.
CBA shares are up 28% since this time last year."

"Pix aumentou competição e inclusão bancária chegou a mais lugares, diz diretor do BC
O diretor de Organização do Sistema Financeiro e Resolução do Banco Central, Renato Gomes, destacou o poder do Pix em aumentar a competição no setor financeiro e permitir que a inclusão bancária chegasse a mais lugares.
Antes do Pix, lembrou, metade das transações comerciais eram feitas em dinheiro e um dos papéis das instituições financeiras era a distribuição de efetivo. Nesse cenário, bancos com redes amplas de agências tinham vantagens competitivas em relação às fintechs, mas a realidade mudou.
“Eram serviços que praticamente obrigavam o sujeito a ser cliente de um grande banco. Com o ecossistema de fintechs, chega o Pix, as pessoas digitalizam suas vidas e não precisam mais ir à agência em busca de efetivo. Isso mudou a vida de muita gente e permitiu que a bancarização chegasse a lugares que eram muito difíceis”, afirmou ele, ao participar do evento Finance of Tomorrow, que discute a regulação e o futuro do sistema financeiro.
“O sujeito tinha que ir para outra cidade para recolher o pagamento... Agora não precisa mais sair de casa, pode fazer tudo pelo smartphone”, completou.
Uma das estatísticas citadas por Gomes para demonstrar o fenômeno da inclusão bancária foi o aumento do número de usuários ativos do sistema financeiro, que considera as pessoas que fizeram pagamentos nos últimos três meses ou operações de crédito em igual período.
No caso das pessoas físicas, entre 2018 e 2023, o número foi de 77 milhões de pessoas para 152 milhões. Entre as pessoas jurídicas, o aumento foi de 3,4 milhões para 12 milhões. “Isso se deve muito à digitalização e oferta desses produtos por meios não físicos, por meio digitais. Houve uma grande inclusão financeira”, disse.
Ainda que positivo, esse movimento de inclusão bancária foi acompanhado por aumento da inadimplência e do endividamento de risco. “Falta um segundo passo é a inclusão financeira qualitativa, que está ajudando as pessoas. O Banco Central tem agenda forte nesse sentido, de identificar os fatores que levam à inadimplência, com iniciativas de educação financeira”, notou."
"Real Digital pode reduzir juros e desafiar apostas online, diz diretor do BC
Publicidade
Real Digital como possibilidade para reduzir a taxa de juros com soluções de crédito colateralizado e competição por dinheiro para consumo e poupança com as BETs são dois exemplos da realidade mais complexa com a transformação digital que precisa ser entendida pela autoridade monetária.
A avaliação é do diretor do Banco Central Gabriel Galípolo, para quem a nova realidade, em alguns momentos, parece uma anedota.
“Parece anedótico. Mas com a evolução que tivemos nas despesas com as chamadas Bets de aposta pode explicar o fato de não estarmos vendo na poupança o crescimento da renda observado nos últimos meses”, disse Galípolo, em um pout-pourri de impressões sobre os impactos monetários das vertiginosas transformações do mercado financeiro.
As declarações ocorreram durante participação de Galípolo no Finance of Tomorrow, que acontece no Rio.
Brasil e as crises
Para ele, o Brasil foi eficiente em lidar com as crises dos últimos 15 anos por meio de instrumentos de intermediação financeira, controlando a liquidez.
As novas tecnologias do setor financeiro, porém, geram dados que precisarão ser estudados e entendidos.
Continua depois da publicidade
“Essa questão das inovações está produzindo uma quantidade enorme de dados para o BC. A gente vai ter um desafio de aprender a trabalhar isso para incorporar os dados que subsidiam a tomada de decisões de política monetária”, disse.
O provável futuro presidente do Banco Central mostrou estar atento às discussões levantadas em todo o mundo em relação a criptomoedas e outras inovações.
Não é possível afirmar que taxa de juros no Brasil seja exorbitante, diz Campos Neto
Segundo presidente do BC, entre 2019 e 2024, o Brasil teve uma menor inflação com uma menor taxa de juros
Campos Neto diz que é preciso perseverar, porque a desinflação perdeu força
Em audiência na Câmara dos Deputados, Campos Neto, disse que volatilidade internacional recente implicou, para o Brasil, em uma inflação de 12 meses que começou a subir um pouco na ponta
Citou estudos de “alguns bancos grandes internacionais” que mostram como o câmbio tem se comportado de maneira diferente, descolando muitas vezes dos fundamentos. Mas não cravou se a volatilidade está ou não ligada às inovações.
Continua depois da publicidade
“Eu acho que a redução na captação de poupança não é só conjuntural, mas também estrutural, por ter novas alternativas de investimento” afirmou.
Nesse cenário, ele considera que a instituição terá uma agenda importante nos próximos anos para entender os novos mecanismos.
Ele quer usá-los para endereçar questões críticas e históricas, como a evolução do crédito rotativo nos últimos anos e os altos spreads bancários, a começar pelo Drex, que o BC apresenta como “o Real em forma digital”.
Continua depois da publicidade
“A infraestrutura que está sendo pensada a partir do DREX pode criar um avanço, uma permissão para que a gente possa avançar com o crédito colateralizado. A gente tem a redução de percepção de risco, que pode reduzir os spreads da maneira correta, a partir da redução de percepção de risco de quem vai conceder o crédito”, disse.
Pix
Galípolo comentou ainda que, mesmo após perder entre 20% e 30% dos seus colaboradores, o Banco Central conseguiu aumentar a produtividade e manter a agenda de Inovação, criando soluções como o Pix.
“Às vezes, queremos resolver problemas da forma tradicional, com investimentos em infraestrutura, como o que precisamos fazer para resolver problemas como o saneamento, que é uma questão do século XIX”, disse.

“Mas, simultaneamente, vemos que o Banco Central consegue fazer coisas como o Pix, que é um caso de excelência em inovação”, acrescentou, reforçando os ganhos trazidos à população com essa tecnologia."
"Fortuna de trilhões: conheça o príncipe saudita que deseja contratar Vini Jr
A notícia sobre o interesse do Al-Ahli na contratação de Vini Jr despertou o interesse sobre o Fundo de Investimento Público da Arábia Saudita. A oferta, a maior da história para um jogador de futebol, tem por trás o primeiro-ministro e príncipe do país, Mohammed Bin Salman. Pertencente a Casa de Saud – nome dado ao poder real no país -, ele faz parte da família de monarcas mais rica do mundo.
De acordo com uma estimativa da consultoria Brand Finance, a fortuna de Bin Salman estava avaliada em US$ 1,4 trilhão (cerca de R$ 7,6 trilhões na cotação atual) até 2023. A oferta bilionária do monarca pelo jogador brasileiro (1 bilhão de euros – R$ 6 bilhões, na cotação atual) é apenas uma mostra de seu gosto por investimentos grandiosos. Nesse sentido, em seu ‘leque de aquisições’ consta um castelo na França, adquirido por R$ 1,7 bilhão de reais, um iate em que gastou R$ 309 milhões e também uma obra de Leonardo Da Vinci, arrematada em 2017 pelo preço recorde de U$ 450 milhões (aproximadamente R$ 2,4 bilhões).
O grande volume financeiro pertencente ao príncipe também é cercado de polêmica. De acordo com a Forbes, parte das reservas de seu governo foi obtida após uma “campanha anticorrupção”. Na ação, Bin Salman arrecadou bilhões de outras famílias monarcas para diminuir o rombo dos caixas devido a baixa do valor do petróleo. Um exemplo é a saída do príncipe e parente Alwaleed bin Talal al Saud do hotel de luxo Ritz-Carlton, em Dubai. Ele precisou pagar US$ 6 bilhões para deixar o local, uma espécie de ‘prisão de luxo’ para os ricos acusados pelo primeiro-ministro.
Príncipe saudita e o interesse pelo futebol – e por Vini
O projeto de investir no futebol da Arábia Saudita para atrair grandes estrelas está ligado ao processo de melhoria da imagem do seu governo dentro e fora do país. Com o nome envolto em escândalos de violação de diretos humanos e outras questões, Bin Salman contratou jogadores da elite europeia para os quatro clubes que comanda no país. Nomes nomes como Benzema (Al-Ittihad), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr), Neymar (Al-Hilal) e Roberto Firmino (Al-Ahli) passaram a ter o príncipe saudita como ‘chefe’. Além disso, ele também é dono do Newcastle United, clube da Premier League adquirido por £ 300 milhões (R$ 2,1 bilhões).
Este fenômeno fez com que o país árabe se tornasse um importante centro esportivo global. O movimento é uma das ações que culminarão na realização da Copa do Mundo de 2034 na Arábia Saudita. Neste pacote, a contratação de Vini Jr seria uma espécie de ‘cereja do bolo’. A ideia era contratar o brasileiro para se tornar o embaixador do país na divulgação do evento que acontecerá daqui a 10 anos. Porém, segundo o jornal The Athletic, o jogador de 24 anos recusou a proposta bilionária e permanecerá no time espanhol.

De acordo com uma estimativa da consultoria Brand Finance, a fortuna de Bin Salman estava avaliada em US$ 1,4 trilhão (cerca de R$ 7,6 trilhões na cotação atual) até 2023. A oferta bilionária do monarca pelo jogador brasileiro (1 bilhão de euros - R$ 6 bilhões, na cotação atual) é apenas uma mostra de seu gosto por investimentos grandiosos. Nesse sentido, em seu 'leque de aquisições' consta um castelo na França, adquirido por R$ 1,7 bilhão de reais, um iate em que gastou R$ 309 milhões e também uma obra de Leonardo Da Vinci, arrematada em 2017 pelo preço recorde de U$ 450 milhões (aproximadamente R$ 2,4 bilhões).

O grande volume financeiro pertencente ao príncipe também é cercado de polêmica. De acordo com a Forbes, parte das reservas de seu governo foi obtida após uma ""campanha anticorrupção"". Na ação, Bin Salman arrecadou bilhões de outras famílias monarcas para diminuir o rombo dos caixas devido a baixa do valor do petróleo. Um exemplo é a saída do príncipe e parente Alwaleed bin Talal al Saud do hotel de luxo Ritz-Carlton, em Dubai. Ele precisou pagar US$ 6 bilhões para deixar o local, uma espécie de 'prisão de luxo' para os ricos acusados pelo primeiro-ministro.
Príncipe saudita e o interesse pelo futebol - e por Vini
O projeto de investir no futebol da Arábia Saudita para atrair grandes estrelas está ligado ao processo de melhoria da imagem do seu governo dentro e fora do país. Com o nome envolto em escândalos de violação de diretos humanos e outras questões, Bin Salman contratou jogadores da elite europeia para os quatro clubes que comanda no país. Nomes nomes como Benzema (Al-Ittihad), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr), Neymar (Al-Hilal) e Roberto Firmino (Al-Ahli) passaram a ter o príncipe saudita como 'chefe'. Além disso, ele também é dono do Newcastle United, clube da Premier League adquirido por £ 300 milhões (R$ 2,1 bilhões).
Este fenômeno fez com que o país árabe se tornasse um importante centro esportivo global. O movimento é uma das ações que culminarão na realização da Copa do Mundo de 2034 na Arábia Saudita. Neste pacote, a contratação de Vini Jr seria uma espécie de 'cereja do bolo'. A ideia era contratar o brasileiro para se tornar o embaixador do país na divulgação do evento que acontecerá daqui a 10 anos. Porém, segundo o jornal The Athletic, o jogador de 24 anos recusou a proposta bilionária e permanecerá no time espanhol.

Crescimento de criptoativos e bets são desafios no Brasil, diz Galípolo
O diretor de política monetária do Banco Central, Gabriel Galípolo, afirmou que o crescimento no volume de criptoativos e de casas de apostas no Brasil são desafios que chamam a atenção no país. Galípolo participou do Finance of Tomorrow nesta terça-feira (13) no Rio de Janeiro. O encontro é organizado pela consultoria Potion, com apoio do Banco Central e da prefeitura da cidade.
O que aconteceu
Galípolo disse que as despesas com bets esportivas estão crescendo. Segundo o diretor do BC, o tema exige análise e pode ser um dos motivos para não haver aumento de poupança em momentos em que há crescimento da renda dos brasileiros.
Tem crescido como um ponto de análise, inclusive com grandes bancos trazendo o assunto, que talvez o crescimento da renda observado nos últimos meses e que não é refletido em crescimento da poupança ou do consumo, possa estar vazando em grande medida para esse tipo de atividade, para os jogos de apostas.
Gabriel Galípolo, diretor de política monetária do BC
A redução na poupança também pode ter relação com mais acesso a outros tipos de investimentos. Galípolo afirma que os brasileiros têm mais informações a respeito de alternativas de investimentos.
O aumento no número de criptoativos não é visto como um problema. Galípolo diz que a dificuldade é entender o mercado. Hoje existe uma discussão sobre como classificar os ativos na contabilidade nacional e as motivações das transações. ""Pode ser de uma maneira mais simples para as pessoas terem acesso a uma conta em dólares, por exemplo, ou pode ter um motivo para a especulação, já que isso não está muito claro para as autoridades monetárias ao redor do mundo"", diz Gabriel Galípolo.
Galípolo elogiou a implementação do Pix. Ele afirma que a adesão do meio de pagamento foi ""inacreditável"" e que se a operação do Pix fosse encerrada por algum motivo, seria pior do que ficar sem água em casa.
Conseguimos produzir um dos casos mais exitosos de infraestrutura pública digital que é o sistema de pagamento instantâneo que é o Pix. Com uma velocidade de adesão inacreditável, presente na vida das pessoas. Acho que se por qualquer razão tivesse a interrupção do serviço do Pix, seria pior do que as pessoas não terem água em suas casas, não terem luz em suas casas. Esse é o nível de dependência que se chegou a partir disso com a qualidade do serviço que foi prestado. Essa é uma agenda que está no DNA do Banco Central.
Gabriel Galipolo, diretor de política monetária do BC
Perda de funcionários
O BC tem menos funcionários atualmente. Isto porque houve a aposentadoria de profissionais sem a reposição de pessoal por meio de concursos públicos. Segundo Galípolo, houve uma perda de 20% a 30% de pessoal nos últimos anos. Apesar da diminuição, ele garante que houve um aumento na produtividade do BC.
Presidência do BC
Galípolo é cotado para ser o substituto do atual presidente do BC, Roberto Campos Neto. Em evento em São Paulo nesta segunda-feira (12), Galípolo rechaçou a afirmação de que será o nome indicado pelo presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva para assumir o posto em 2025 e defendeu Campos Neto. ""Ele está exercendo na sua plenitude a presidência do BC, de maneira ultragenerosa com todos os diretores"", afirmou.
Ele destacou ainda que seu mandato se encerra em março de 2027. Primeiro diretor indicado por Lula para a atual diretoria do BC, Galípolo defendeu a necessidade de elevar a credibilidade da autoridade monetária. Para isso, o diretor de política monetária destaca a necessidade de ""falas e ações coerentes"".

"Câmbio tem se comportado de forma diferente, descolado de fundamentos, afirma Galípolo
O diretor de política monetária do Banco Central, Gabriel Galípolo, comentou nesta terça-feira (13) sobre o comportamento diferente do câmbio, que ""tem se descolado muitas vezes dos fundamentos [macroeconômicos]”, após as mudanças dos últimos anos.
Ele destacou que há diferentes estudos sobre isso, de grandes bancos internacionais, e ponderou que as inovações do sistema financeiro e do próprio Banco Central produzem “uma quantidade enorme de dados”.
“Alguns bancos grandes internacionais têm trazido, por exemplo, como o câmbio tem se comportado de maneira diferente, se descolando muitas vezes dos fundamentos. Há vários estudos sobre volatilidade”, disse ele, ao participar do evento Finance of Tomorrow, no Rio.
Galípolo reforçou que há um desafio para incorporar essas informações e garantir que sejam usadas para ajudar na tomada de decisões em política monetária do Banco Central.
“Essa questão das inovações do BC está produzindo uma quantidade enorme de dados para o BC. [...] A gente vai ter bastante tempo para conseguir, um desafio de aprender a trabalhar isso para incorporar os dados que subsidiam a tomada de decisões de política monetária”, notou.
'Parceria público-privada'
Durante o evento, Galípolo comentou ainda que a parceria entre o poder público e o setor privado no setor financeiro tem tido sucesso em inovações e no estímulo à concorrência. Ele classificou o trabalho conjunto no setor como “talvez a primeira Parceria Público-Privada a partir da criação do Estado moderno” e disse que as agendas conjuntas ajudam no empreendedorismo e para a entrada de novos entrantes no mercado.
“É essencial, e o Banco Central teve muito sucesso nisso, fomentar agendas que permitam maior empreendedorismo, maior concorrência, novos entrantes....”, notou.
“Talvez seja a primeira parceria público-privada a partir da criação do Estado moderno. É feita uma gestão conjunta, através da intermediação bancária, entre o setor público e o setor privado, de um bem público, mas que também é uma riqueza privada”, disse.
Galípolo também defendeu que haja abertura para que o setor privado também faça sugestões de regulações e inovações, já que são as instituições financeiras que estão mais perto dos clientes.
“Sempre é importante lembrar nessa gestão conjunta a intermediação significa que quem tem a relação na ponta com o cliente é o setor privado. Não quer dizer que o poder público não possa formular sugestões, mas quem está com o cliente, conhecendo as dores, em grande medida é a iniciativa privada”, afirmou, para complementar. “É muito importante que isso seja uma via de mão dupla. Não seja simplesmente uma via onde o poder público vai conceder, eventualmente, uma solução nova, uma regulação.”"
"Não ter Pix hoje seria como não ter luz ou água nas casas brasileiras, diz Galípolo
O diretor de política monetária do Banco Central, Gabriel Galípolo, afirmou nesta terça-feira (13) que o Banco Central criou um nível de excelência na agenda de inovações e comparou que um problema no sistema do Pix hoje seria como “faltar luz ou água na casa brasileiras”.
Ao participar do evento Finance of Tomorrow, no Rio, ele disse que o Brasil enfrenta, ao mesmo tempo, problemas do século XIX, como a falta de saneamento básico, como questões digitais, como é o serviço do Pix.
“Hoje não ter o Pix seria como não ter luz ou água nas casas brasileiras. Criou-se um nível de excelência na agenda de inovação [do Banco Central]. A agenda [de inovações] em si faz parte do DNA do BC”, disse.
Ao ser questionado sobre os recursos existentes para o trabalho do Banco Central, Galípolo afirmou que o BC perdeu de 20% a 30% de seus servidores por causa de aposentadorias nos últimos anos, mas que a autoridade monetária produz cada vez mais para a sociedade brasileira, especialmente no que se refere à infraestrutura digital.
“O Banco Central perdeu de 20% a 30% do seu pessoal e hoje entrega mais coisas, mais infraestrutura pública e digital. Por aí se mede o ganho de produtividade dos servidores para a sociedade brasileira. [...]É uma questão de ter capacidade de recursos para [o Banco Central] entregar as inovações”, notou."
"Arquitetura do sistema financeiro colaborou para que a gente enfrentasse últimas crises, diz Galípolo
O diretor de política monetária do Banco Central, Gabriel Galípolo, afirmou nesta terça-feira (13) que a arquitetura do sistema financeiro brasileiro colaborou para que o país enfrentasse as últimas crises. Ao participar do evento Finance of Tomorrow, no Rio, disse que o Banco Central usou a intermediação bancária e financeira para forneceder liquidez sem precisar entrar diretamente no mercado.
“A arquitetura do sistema financeiro colaborou para que a gente enfrentasse as últimas crises. O BC se valeu da intermediação bancária e financeira, fornecedendo liquidez sem precisar entrar diretamente”, notou ele.
Galípolo comentou também sobre o mercado de apostas, as chamadas bets. No seu entendimento, parte do aumento da renda, que não tem se traduzido em consumo ou poupança, pode estar se direcionando a esse nicho.
“As despesas com bets, dos jogos de apostas, têm crescido como ponto de análise. Talvez crescimento da renda possa estar vazando para este tipo de atividade”, afirmou.
Embora possa parecer anedótico, completou Galípolo, há relatos de representantes de supermercados e de redes de varejo que apontam para esse caminho.
Ao ser questionado sobre criatividade e inovação no setor financeiro, o diretor do Banco Central destacou as transformações ocorridas nos últimos anos, que ajudaram a ampliar a competição e o empreendedorismo.
Galípolo também comentou sobre a redução da captação de recursos pela poupança. Esse movimento, segundo ele, é mais estrutural que conjuntural, pelo maior acesso da população a outras formas de investimento.
“A redução da captação da poupança não é conjuntural, mas estrutural. [...] Pelas pessoas terem mais acesso a investimentos e conhecimento”, disse."
"BDRs de REITs na B3: uma forma de investir em ativos imobiliários além das fronteiras
Os REITs (Real Estate Investment Trust), que ainda não são tão populares no mercado de investimentos brasileiro, apresentam-se como alternativas para a diversificação na carteira de investimentos.
Por isso, neste artigo, vamos falar sobre as características desses ativos e os meios para acessá-los.
Curiosamente, os REITs são apelidados de “fundos imobiliários americanos” ou “primos dos nossos FIIs”,
O que são REITs?
Na verdade, os REITs são empresas com foco no setor imobiliário, listadas nas bolsas americanas.
O investidor que adquire esse ativo, torna-se acionista de uma corporação e tem direito a receber parcela dos lucros gerados por ela, ou seja, proventos.
Portanto, são empresas que possuem empreendimentos, operam e financiam imóveis geradores de renda.
A dinâmica dos REITs é semelhante à dos fundos imobiliários considerando a forma que empresas geram lucros para seus investidores.
Para resumir, existem três estratégias comuns:
- Equity: a maior parte dos REITs é baseada na exploração de imóveis físicos. São ‘equivalentes’ aos fundos de tijolos.
- Mortgage: neste caso, as empresas não investem em imóveis, mas sim em títulos de crédito imobiliários. É o caso de hipotecas ou recebíveis, por exemplo. Equivalem aos fundos de papel.
- Hybrid: em alguns casos, um REIT pode mesclar as duas estratégias – imóveis físicos e títulos de dívida. Dessa forma, a empresa é considerada híbrida.
Além disso, os REITs são obrigados a distribuir 70% dos lucros sob as regras do mercado de valores mobiliários dos EUA. Ao contrário dos fundos imobiliários no Brasil que devem distribuir, no mínimo, 90% dos lucros auferidos, de acordo com a regulamentação local.
Hoje, existem mais de 200 REITs nas bolsas dos EUA. É uma indústria de aproximadamente US$ 1,4 trilhão.
Existem REITs de diversos setores, como empreendimentos residenciais e corporativos, hotelaria, logística e galpões industriais, shopping centers e varejo.
Como investir nessa categoria de ativos imobiliários?
Para investir nesses ativos, os investidores podem abrir uma conta em uma corretora nos Estados Unidos para acessar as bolsas de lá. Hoje, algumas corretoras brasileiras também facilitam esse acesso.
Outra forma é através dos BDRs de REITs na Bolsa de Valores Brasileira, que podem ser negociados diretamente em corretoras e plataformas no Brasil. Ainda nesse artigo, vamos falar mais sobre eles.
Existem ainda os ETFs de REITs que seguem índices do segmento, disponíveis na Bolsa brasileira como por exemplo o URET11 da XP Asset, que replica o FTSE Nareit Equity REITS Index, ou o ALUG11, da Investo, que segue o índice MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate.
Por fim, existem fundos de investimento com foco em REITs. Embora muito poucos sejam oferecidos no país, são canais práticos para acessar esses ativos sob a gestão de especialistas na área.

Os REITs são ativos de renda variável, portanto arriscados. Hoje, estão sujeitos a condições macroeconômicas desafiadoras e a uma desaceleração econômica global, especialmente nos Estados Unidos.
Se forem bem avaliados pelos profissionais de investimentos, alguns podem estar em ponto de entrada, sendo uma alternativa focada no médio e longo prazo nas carteiras dos investidores, obviamente, respeitando os objetivos e o perfis de risco de cada um.
Os REITs são uma maneira de investir principalmente no mercado imobiliário dos EUA, a maior economia do mundo ou em outras localidades, além das nossas fronteiras."

'Teve CEO de banco que disse que Pix não ia dar certo', diz membro do BC
O Pix é um sucesso no Brasil, mas foi desacreditado antes de seu lançamento. O coordenador do Drex no Banco Central, Fabio Araujo, afirma que executivos de grandes bancos duvidaram que o novo meio de pagamento daria certo no Brasil. Araujo participou do Finance of Tomorrow, evento paralelo do G20 realizado nesta terça-feira (13) no Rio de Janeiro. O encontro reúne reguladores do Brasil e América Latina e é organizado pela consultoria Potion, com apoio do Banco Central e da prefeitura da cidade.
O que aconteceu
Hoje há 778,5 milhões de chaves Pix cadastradas, e número cresce a cada mês. Em junho, foram movimentados R$ 2,2 trilhões pelo meio de pagamento. Os dados são do Banco Central.
Araujo diz que o Pix foi duvidado no início. Segundo ele, houve a interpretação de que o Pix seria apenas um meio de pagamento mais rápido do que os existentes e que, por isso, não pegaria tanto no país, nem traria mudanças significativas para o sistema financeiro.
O Pix é fácil de louvar. Mas até o parto, tiveram vários problemas. Teve CEO de banco grande dizendo que isso não ia dar certo, que ia ser só um TED mais rápido, para que ia fazer isso?
Fabio Araujo, coordenador do Drex no BC
O grande sucesso do Pix foi resolver um problema que as pessoas não sabiam que tinham. Araujo afirma que antes muitos brasileiros iam até o banco sacar o salário no dia do pagamento, e que o Pix mudou este hábito, entre tantos outros.
Segurança e controle de fraude é uma preocupação constante do BC sobre o Pix. Angelo Duarte, chefe do departamento de competição de estrutura do mercado financeiro do Banco Central, afirma que os desafios não param e que hoje os golpes envolvendo engenharia social são mais comuns do que fraudes envolvendo o Pix.
O BC cria as regras e controla se todos os players estão adotando tudo o que é preciso. Segundo Duarte, se a aplicação não é bem feita, todo o sistema é prejudicado.
Duarte afirma que o Pix foi o responsável por pressionar outros meios de pagamento a evoluírem. Ele cita a necessidade do mercado de cartões de crédito melhorarem o débito no e-commerce por causa do Pix, por exemplo.
Novidade no Pix
Uma das novidades do Pix é o automático. A funcionalidade está prevista para 16 de junho de 2025. Ele vai funcionar como um débito automático, mas para mais empresas.
A aposta do BC é alcançar mais pessoas com praticidade. Mesmo que já exista a função de agendar pagamentos recorrentes pelo débito automático, a avaliação é de que a adesão será maior com o Pix. Isso porque a empresa precisa ter convênio com cada instituição financeira para oferecer o débito automático, ou seja, parte dos clientes costuma ficar sem essa opção.

"Conheça projeto indígena que quer usar tecnologia blockchain para promover inclusão financeira
Na Terra Indígena Sete de Setembro, localizada entre o município de Cacoal, Rondônia, até o município de Aripuanã, em Mato Grosso, o povo Paiter-Suruí está preocupado com a gestão do seu território no longo prazo.
O avanço a bioeconomia, atividade econômica baseada na agregação de valor de ""ativos"" disponíveis na natureza, combinada obrigatoriamente com a preservação e a restauração da biodiversidade, traz possibilidades para os povos da florestas, mas a burocracia e o baixo letramento digital são alguns dos empecilhos para acessá-las, diz Uraan Anderson Surui, vice-cacique geral do Povo Paiter-Suruí.
Para fazer frente a esse cenário, o cacique da Aldeia Gamir buscou na tecnologia blockchain e na Web3 - a nova fase da internet, baseada em blockchain - as ferramentas para capacitar sua comunidade.
Blockchain é a tecnologia de banco de dados criptografados que permite compartilhamento transparente e seguro de informações. São redes de registros públicos permanentes e invioláveis.
É a base tecnológica para criptomoedas e aplicações como contratos inteligentes (smart contracts) e monitoramento de cadeias produtivas, entre outras possibilidades.
Em sua casa na aldeia, a 480 km de Porto Velho, capital de Rondônia, ele abriu recentemente a Amazon Tech House, iniciativa inédita com o objetivo de capacitar as comunidades indígenas da Amazônia, oferecendo um espaço para aprendizado, inclusão digital e proporcionando acesso a recursos tecnológicos.

“Com a nossa tech house temos a possibilidade de nos formar em cursos de ensino a distância, dentro ou fora do Brasil, diretamente da floresta amazônica. Além disso, podemos aproveitar a Web3 para acessar financiamentos para projetos”, disse durante o Finance of Tomorrow, evento paralelo ao G20, grupo de 19 países mais União Europeia e Africana, que acontece no Rio de Janeiro e reúne reguladores, representantes de fintechs, bancos centrais e líderes financeiros.
Para a autoridade indígena, o blockchain também se alinha aos propósitos da Cooperativa Agroflorestal Suruí (COOPSU), voltada a agricultura sustentável e regenerativa, tanto do ponto de vista tecnológico, que permite ganhos para o rastreamento dos produtos e transparência para os projetos, quando do ponto de vista do fortalecimento da comunidade.
“Construímos nossa cooperativa resgatando nossa cultura, que é de cooperação. Percebemos que havíamos perdido essa identidade, entrando num campo de disputas e e concorrência. Isso não deu certo pro nosso povo. E o blockchain traz isso: essa cooperação”, pontuou.
Com a tecnologia blockchain é possível, por exemplo, propor a captação via DAOs (sigla em inglês para Organização Autônoma Descentralizada), comunidades onde propostas com impacto público são avaliadas, votadas e recebem apoio dos usuários em troca de tokens (uma vantagem importante para quem está acostumado a navegar por essa esfera digital).
Essa é uma das razões pelas quais o líder avalia ser importante capacitar seu povo para buscar novos caminhos de impulsionar os projetos.
“Às vezes é mais fácil conversar com um robô do que com um gerente de banco”, diz o cacique da Aldeia Gamir, que é formado pela Universidade Federal de Rondônia na área de Ciências da Linguagem.

"Veja o que já se sabe sobre o Pix por aproximação, que será implementado em fevereiro de 2025
Veja o que já se sabe sobre o Pix por aproximação, que será implementado em fevereiro de 2025
Nova funcionalidade irá operar aos moldes das wallets, as carteiras digitais já usadas para operações de débito e crédito; veja perguntas e respostas
O Banco Central irá iniciar os testes do Pix por aproximação em novembro, informou a instituição no começo de agosto. Com a implantação, o cliente não precisará mais entrar no aplicativo do banco para realizar os pagamentos, pois a nova a funcionalidade irá operar aos moldes das wallets, as carteiras digitais já usadas para operações de débito e crédito. A previsão, segundo o BC, é de que essa modalidade de Pix sejam implementadas oficialmente em fevereiro do ano que vem.

De acordo com a BC, a implementação será obrigatória a partir de novembro de 2024 para as instituições detentoras de conta que movimentaram 99% das transações de iniciação de pagamento, e a partir de janeiro de 2026 para as demais instituições detentoras de conta participantes obrigatórias no Pix, informou o órgão. Veja abaixo perguntas e respostas sobre o que já se sabe sobre o Pix por aproximação.
Como vai funcionar?
Os bancos têm se preparado para oferecer o Pix por aproximação diante das novas regras do Banco Central que permitem a chamada jornada sem redirecionamento (veja mais abaixo). Em resumo, a modalidade permite que um detentor de conta faça pagamentos usando o Pix sem ter de abrir o aplicativo do banco ou digitar a senha. O que torna a funcionalidade possível é o chamado Open Finance, infraestrutura que permite o compartilhamento voluntário das informações de cada cliente bancário entre as instituições financeiras.
Quando começa?
Pelo cronograma definido do BC, em fevereiro de 2025, com testes previstos para serem realizados em novembro deste ano. No entanto, o mercado se adiantou à regulação do BC. O Itaú, por exemplo, lançará o Pix por aproximação em outubro, com aceitação pelas maquininhas da Rede. Em paralelo, o Google anunciou a inclusão do Pix no Google Pay, sua carteira digital, para clientes do C6 Bank e do PicPay em um primeiro momento. O modelo que o BC pretende impulsionar não é o de arranjos fechados. Já a Caixa Econômica Federal deve lançar o Pix por aproximação para os clientes até fevereiro do ano que vem, segundo informou o banco público ao Estadão/Broadcast. O banco prepara outros lançamentos relacionados a pagamentos, como a iniciação de pagamentos e a inserção dos cartões em carteira digital.
O que é o pagamento online sem redirecionamento?
Atualmente, para fazer o pagamento com Pix de alguma compra online, o cliente precisa deixar o ambiente virtual em que está, entrar no aplicativo de seu banco e fazer o Pix, seja pelo sistema copia e cola, digitando a chave fornecida ou escaneando o QRCode. Sem o direcionamento, o pagamento será efetuado na própria plataforma onde a compra está sendo feita. Funcionará aos moldes do que ocorre hoje com quem deixa cartão de crédito cadastrado em determinado site em que faz suas compras online.
Pagamento por aproximação funciona em qualquer celular?
Nem todos, apenas nos que dispõe do NFC, uma tecnologia de comunicação sem fio que permite a transferência de dados de um dispositivo para outro, desde que estejam próximos. Para saber se o seu celular possui essa tecnologia, busque por NFC nas configurações do aparelho.
Quais são as exigências para as instituições de pagamento?
O BC estabeleceu exigências mínimas de capital social integralizado e de patrimônio líquido para as instituições de pagamentos, válidos a partir de 1º de janeiro de 2026, inclusive para as instituições que tenham formalizado pedido para funcionamento até 30 de setembro de 2024.
Entre as exigências, estão os limites mínimos de R$ 2 milhões para cada função de ""emissor de moeda eletrônica"", ""emissor de instrumento de pagamento pós-pago"" ou ""credenciador"" acumuladas pelas instituições, conforme a resolução nº 80 do BC. A exigência aumenta em R$ 1 milhão caso a instituição também tenha a classificação de ""iniciador de transação de pagamento."""
"Dólar tem leve queda, em linha com emergentes, após dados de inflação nos EUA
Dólar tem leve queda, em linha com emergentes, após dados de inflação nos EUA
O dólar tinha leve queda frente ao real nesta terça-feira, em linha com a fraqueza da moeda norte-americana em alguns mercados emergentes, à medida que investidores analisam dados de inflação nos Estados Unidos e comentários de membros do Banco Central ao longo da sessão.
Às 9h45, O dólar à vista caía 0,23%, a 5,4859 reais na venda. Na B3, o contrato de dólar futuro de primeiro vencimento tinha queda de 0,44%, a 5,483 reais na venda
Na véspera, o dólar à vista fechou o dia em queda de 0,30%, cotado a 5,4984 reais
Nesta manhã, investidores globais estavam focados na divulgação de dados do índice de preços ao produtor dos EUA (PPI, na sigla em inglês) em julho, em busca de sinais sobre o progresso da batalha do Federal Reserve contra a inflação e o futuro de sua política monetária.
O Departamento de Trabalho informou que o índice teve alta de 0,1% na base mensal em julho, ante 0,2% no mês anterior, em resultado ligeiramente abaixo do esperado por economistas em pesquisa da Reuters, que projetavam um avanço de 0,2%.
Em 12 meses, o índice desacelerou para 2,2%, de 2,7% revisados para cima em junho.
Os números reforçam o argumento sobre um arrefecimento da inflação nos EUA em meio ao ciclo de aperto monetário do Fed, iniciado em 2022.
Números mais moderados de preços e de emprego já vinham sustentando as apostas de que o banco central dos EUA iniciará um ciclo de afrouxamento monetário em sua reunião de setembro, com os operadores dividindo suas apostas entre um corte de 25 ou de 50 pontos-base.
Em tese, quanto mais o Fed reduzir os juros, pior para o dólar, que se torna comparativamente menos atrativo para investidores estrangeiros, gerando um redirecionamento de capital para locais com ativos mais rentáveis, como o Brasil.
""Acho que no front externo o PPI ajudou e aliviou o dólar... isso em movimento global. Me parece um movimento bem alinhado"", disse Fernando Bergallo, diretor de operações da FB Capital.
Na quarta-feira, todas as atenções se voltarão para a divulgação do índice de preços ao consumidor dos EUA (CPI, na sigla em inglês) de julho, que mostrarão como as pressões inflacionários estão chegando aos consumidores norte-americanos.
Analistas consultados pela Reuters projetam aceleração do índice na base mensal para 0,2%, ante queda de 0,1% no mês anterior. Em 12 meses, a pesquisa aponta para alta de 3,0%, mesmo nível de junho.
Dessa forma, o dólar mostrava fraqueza em mercados emergentes, caindo ante o peso mexicano, o rand sul-africano e o peso chileno.
No cenário nacional, investidores estarão focados em eventos com a participação de membros do BC, em busca de qualquer indicação sobre a trajetória futura da Selic, mantida em 10,50% ao ano nas duas últimas reuniões da autoridade monetária.
O presidente da autarquia, Roberto Campos Neto, participará de audiência pública na Câmara dos Deputados às 10h, enquanto o diretor de Política Monetária, Gabriel Galípolo, comparece ao evento ""Finance of Tomorrow"", no Rio de Janeiro.
Na segunda-feira, Galípolo, em particular, comentou sobre a recente volatilidade do dólar no Brasil, que chegou a ultrapassar 5,86 reais há uma semana.
Segundo ele, não há um problema de liquidez no mercado de câmbio à vista brasileiro e que o BC também avaliou que não seria correto fazer uma atuação extraordinária no mercado de derivativos nos momentos de pico do dólar.
O índice do dólar -- que mede o desempenho da moeda norte-americana frente a uma cesta de seis divisas -- caía 0,01%, a 103,070."
"Ibovespa Futuro sobe com atenção dividida entre inflação dos EUA e falas do BC
Publicidade
O Ibovespa Futuro opera em alta nos primeiros negócios desta terça-feira (13), com investidores monitorando a participação de membros do Banco Central (BC) em eventos ao longo dia, enquanto repercutem os dados de inflação ao produtor nos Estados Unidos abaixo do previsto.
O índice de preços ao produtor (PPI na sigla em inglês) dos Estado Unidos subiu 0,1% em julho na comparação mensal. Na comparação com o mesmo mês do ano passado, o índice também desacelerou para 2,2%, após registrar 2,7% em junho.
A alta mensal foi menor que a esperada pelo consenso LSEG de analistas, que previa um PPI de 0,2%. Para o indicador em 12 meses, também era esperada uma inflação mais intensa, de 2,3%.
Às 10h, Roberto Campos Neto, presidente do BC, participa de audiência pública conjunta entre as comissões de Finanças e Tributação, e de Desenvolvimento Econômico. Mais tarde, Gabriel Galípolo, diretor do BC, dá palestra no evento “Finance of Tomorrow”, no Rio de Janeiro.
Na seara política, a Câmara dos Deputados aprovou um requerimento que confere tramitação em regime de urgência para o projeto de lei que trata da regulamentação do Imposto sobre Bens e Serviços (IBS), novo tributo instituído pela reforma tributária já aprovada pelo Congresso. Já o Senado pautou votação de repactuação de dívidas dos estados hoje e desoneração da folha para amanhã.
Às 9h36 (horário de Brasília), o índice futuro com vencimento em agosto subia 0,48%, aos 132.080 pontos.

Em Wall Street, Dow Jones Futuro operava com alta de 0,10%, S&P500 subia 0,38% e Nasdaq Futuro avançava 0,60%, à medida que investidores montam posições antes da divulgação do índice preços ao produtor (PPI, na sigla em inglês), e às vésperas do índice de preços ao consumidor (CPI, na sigla em inglês) nos Estados Unidos.
Ibovespa, dólar e mercado externo
O dólar comercial operava com queda de 0,31%, cotado a R$ 5,478 na compra e R$ 5,479 na venda. Já o dólar futuro (DOLFUT) caía 0,30%, indo aos 5.491 pontos.
No mercado de commodities, os preços do petróleo operam em baixa, interrompendo uma sequência de cinco dias de ganhos, à medida que os investidores voltaram a se concentrar nas preocupações com a demanda depois que a OPEP (Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróelo) cortou na segunda-feira (12) sua previsão de crescimento da demanda em 2024 devido às expectativas mais fracas na China.

As cotações do minério de ferro na China caíram pela segunda sessão consecutiva, já que a demanda fraca em meio a cortes na produção de aço no principal consumidor, a China, superou o suporte de algumas atividades de cobertura de posições vendidas.
Já os principais índices do Japão subiram acentuadamente, com a retomada das negociações de ações do país após um feriado na véspera, em meio a uma alta mais ampla nos mercados asiáticos.
O parlamento japonês planeja realizar uma sessão especial na próxima semana para discutir a decisão do Banco do Japão de aumentar as taxas de juros no mês passado, informou a Reuters."

"Reguladores veem mais concorrência com inovações
O Banco Central (BC) e a Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) estão apostando alto na inovação para aumentar a concorrência, aperfeiçoar produtos e melhorar serviços do mercado de capitais e financeiro. As medidas discutidas estão alinhadas aos movimentos de “open finance” e “open capital markets” de abertura de informações e infraestruturas."
"Novas tecnologias colocam moedas digitais e Bets na agenda da gestão monetária
Publicidade
Real Digital como possibilidade para reduzir a taxa de juros com soluções de crédito colateralizado e competição por dinheiro para consumo e poupança com as BETs são dois exemplos da realidade mais complexa com a transformação digital que precisa ser entendida pela autoridade monetária.
A avaliação é do diretor do Banco Central Gabriel Galípolo, para quem a nova realidade, em alguns momentos, parece uma anedota.
“Parece anedótico. Mas com a evolução que tivemos nas despesas com as chamadas Bets de aposta pode explicar o fato de não estarmos vendo na poupança o crescimento da renda observado nos últimos meses”, disse Galípolo, em um pout-pourri de impressões sobre os impactos monetários das vertiginosas transformações do mercado financeiro.
As declarações ocorreram durante participação de Galípolo no Finance of Tomorrow, que acontece no Rio.
Brasil e as crises
Para ele, o Brasil foi eficiente em lidar com as crises dos últimos 15 anos por meio de instrumentos de intermediação financeira, controlando a liquidez.
As novas tecnologias do setor financeiro, porém, geram dados que precisarão ser estudados e entendidos.

“Essa questão das inovações está produzindo uma quantidade enorme de dados para o BC. A gente vai ter um desafio de aprender a trabalhar isso para incorporar os dados que subsidiam a tomada de decisões de política monetária”, disse.
O provável futuro presidente do Banco Central mostrou estar atento às discussões levantadas em todo o mundo em relação a criptomoedas e outras inovações.
Não é possível afirmar que taxa de juros no Brasil seja exorbitante, diz Campos Neto
Segundo presidente do BC, entre 2019 e 2024, o Brasil teve uma menor inflação com uma menor taxa de juros
Campos Neto diz que é preciso perseverar, porque a desinflação perdeu força
Em audiência na Câmara dos Deputados, Campos Neto, disse que volatilidade internacional recente implicou, para o Brasil, em uma inflação de 12 meses que começou a subir um pouco na ponta
Citou estudos de “alguns bancos grandes internacionais” que mostram como o câmbio tem se comportado de maneira diferente, descolando muitas vezes dos fundamentos. Mas não cravou se a volatilidade está ou não ligada às inovações.

“Eu acho que a redução na captação de poupança não é só conjuntural, mas também estrutural, por ter novas alternativas de investimento” afirmou.
Nesse cenário, ele considera que a instituição terá uma agenda importante nos próximos anos para entender os novos mecanismos.
Ele quer usá-los para endereçar questões críticas e históricas, como a evolução do crédito rotativo nos últimos anos e os altos spreads bancários, a começar pelo Drex, que o BC apresenta como “o Real em forma digital”.

“A infraestrutura que está sendo pensada a partir do DREX pode criar um avanço, uma permissão para que a gente possa avançar com o crédito colateralizado. A gente tem a redução de percepção de risco, que pode reduzir os spreads da maneira correta, a partir da redução de percepção de risco de quem vai conceder o crédito”, disse.
Pix
Galípolo comentou ainda que, mesmo após perder entre 20% e 30% dos seus colaboradores, o Banco Central conseguiu aumentar a produtividade e manter a agenda de Inovação, criando soluções como o Pix.
“Às vezes, queremos resolver problemas da forma tradicional, com investimentos em infraestrutura, como o que precisamos fazer para resolver problemas como o saneamento, que é uma questão do século XIX”, disse.

“Mas, simultaneamente, vemos que o Banco Central consegue fazer coisas como o Pix, que é um caso de excelência em inovação”, acrescentou, reforçando os ganhos trazidos à população com essa tecnologia."
"Pix automático chega em 2025; 'Bancos não veem a hora', diz BC
O pix automático era esperado para 2024, mas acabou ficando mesmo para 2025. Com ele será possível fazer pagamentos recorrentes (semanal, quinzenal, mensal), de valores variados. Um avanço ao que temos hoje, em que o pix programado, que permite o pagamento periódico de valores fixos. A novidade, que chegará em junho, não é só aguardada pelos usuários, mas também por uma parcela de instituições financeiras, pontuou Ângelo Duarte, chefe do Departamento de Competição e de Estrutura do Mercado Financeiro do BC, durante o evento Finance of Tomorrow.
“O pagamento automático de valores variados veio para consertar um problema de barreira de entrada. As instituições de pagamentos e bancos digitais tinham dificuldades em acessar contratos com grandes operadoras de serviços públicos. Agora, com o pix automático, essas grandes empresas poderão fazer contratos para o recebimento de contas com qualquer instituição participante do arranjo pix. E, ao mesmo tempo, o usuário poderá usar qualquer uma dessas instituições para fazer seus pagamentos”, explicou durante o evento paralelo ao G20, grupo de 19 países mais União Europeia e Africana, e que reúne no Rio de Janeiro reguladores, representantes de fintechs, bancos centrais e líderes financeiros.
Um dos aspectos para o sucesso do pix entre as instituições financeiras é a possibilidade de instituições de diferentes tamanhos acessarem o meio de pagamento instantâneo e poderem criar produtos e serviços a partir dele. Já entre as empresas, Duarte elenca os ganhos a rapidez na confirmação dos pagamentos recebidos.
“Isso capturou uma parcela importante que o cartão de crédito não conseguia atender. O pix botou pressão nos outros meios de pagamentos e entre os incumbentes. O débito no e-commerce só surgiu depois do pix”, afirmou.
Leticia Tavares, líder da área jurídica na Wise para a América Latina, comentou que o meio de pagamentos instantâneo brasileiro gerou mudanças dentro da corretora de câmbio. “Trabalhamos com pagamentos instantâneos do mundo todo, mas o pix foi uma grande evolução. Depois que implementamos o pix em nossa plataforma tivemos um crescimento exponencial da presença do Brasil nas transações dos clientes. Além disso, a empresa inteira passou a falar de pix. Hoje, são cinco mil funcionários falando disso”.
Fabio Araujo, coordenador do Drex no Banco Central, afirmou, durante evento no Rio de Janeiro, que o pix tem seu poder reconhecido entre a sociedade - o pix representou 39% de todas as transações de pagamento realizadas no país em 2023, enquanto os cartões de crédito, débito e pré-pagos, juntos, responderam por 41% do total, segundo o BC -. Mas no começo houve uma certa resistência das instituições ao mecanismo.
“Ouvimos muitos executivos de bancos que não acreditavam na ideia. Mas o pix resolveu um problema que as pessoas nem sabiam que tinham, que era a possibilidade da conveniência. De não precisar sacar o dinheiro para fazer seus pagamentos. O pix representou a entrada de 71 milhões de pessoas no sistema financeira e na cidadania digital”, sustentou.
Para Araújo, a adesão ao pix traz novas possibilidades dentro de um contexto de economia cada vez mais digital.
“Vivemos num ambiente rico em dados e as empresas estao aprendendo a usar essas informações. O pix trouxe um contingente massivo de pessoas que estavam fora das operações bancárias. Tendo mais gente consumindo nesse espaço digital, novos serviços podem ser explorados. O open finance e o Drex são exemplo disso e resultado de processos conectados para aumentar a eficiência para as pessoas""."
"Abertura econômica é caminho para desenvolvimento
País precisa de abertura econômica para crescer, dizem donos do Plano Real
O caminho para o Brasil atingir o desenvolvimento econômico é a aplicação de reformas que promovam a abertura da economia brasileira. Esta é a visão do ex-ministro da Fazenda Pedro Malan e do ex-presidente do Banco Central Gustavo Franco. Ambos participaram nesta segunda-feira (12) do Finance of Tomorrow, evento paralelo do G20 realizado no Rio de Janeiro pela consultoria Potion, com apoio do Banco Central e da prefeitura da cidade.
O que aconteceu
Franco comparou o Brasil com a Coreia do Sul. O ex-presidente do BC afirma que o país asiático soube aproveitar a globalização para abrir sua economia e se tornar rico. Franco criticou a ""autossuficiência"" do Brasil e as iniciativas de substituição de importação por produção nacional.
Aqui optamos pela autossuficiência, substituição de importação por conteúdo nacional, esse lero lero que ainda está muito vivo. Foi um erro. A Coreia ficou muito rica e o Brasil ficou para trás. Se eu pudesse fazer uma reforma, eu escolheria essa.
Gustavo Franco, ex-presidente do BC
O desenvolvimento tecnológico é um dos motores do crescimento econômico, segundo Malan. Para o ex-ministro, países como Japão, Coreia e Taiwan perceberam que é importante reduzir a distância tecnológica que existe com os países desenvolvidos.
O verdadeiro motor do crescimento é o desenvolvimento tecnológico. Isso depende de investimento em gente. De educação, com política pública.
Pedro Malan, ex-ministro da Fazenda
Malan também defende a necessidade de integração entre os países. Para o economista, o Brasil precisa ter maior integração com outros locais do ponto de vista financeiro, tecnológico e comercial.
Inflação
Malan afirmou que os brasileiros não vão permitir que nenhum governo seja leniente com a inflação. ""A sociedade brasileira hoje não permitirá que nenhum governo tenha uma atitude excessivamente leniente e complacente acerca da inflação"", afirmou Malan.
A inflação brasileira chegou ao teto da meta em julho. A variação ficou acima da previsão do mercado e o IPCA acumula alta de 4,5% nos últimos 12 meses. Em evento nesta segunda, o presidente do BC, Roberto Campos Neto, disse que está ""sedimentado"" entre os diretores da autarquia o consenso de que farão o que for preciso para trazer a inflação para a meta.
A sociedade brasileira hoje não permitirá que nenhum governo tem uma atitude excessivamente leniente e complacente a cerca da inflação.

"Da conta digital ao Drex, entenda como a tecnologia influenciou mudanças regulatórias
Dentro do Banco Central, não há dúvidas de que o pix, meio de pagamento instantâneo, e o open finance, o sistema financeiro aberto, vão evoluir nos próximos anos, permitindo aos brasileiros ter serviços financeiros cada vez mais customizados. O que muita gente nem percebe é que ambos são resultados do uso intenso da tecnologia no setor financeiro. Com as inovações saindo do papel, regulações importantes foram criadas, disse Otávio Damaso, diretor de regulação do Banco Central, durante o evento Finance of Tomorrow.
Ao menos três regulações (veja abaixo) foram construídas diante do ganho de tração da tecnologia entre as instituições financeiras. E essas regulações foram relevantes para que hoje esteja entre nós o pix e o sistema financeiro aberto, que permite ao usuário compartilhar um conjunto de dados, para, em troca, receber propostas de produtos e serviços de diferentes instituições - mesmo sem ser cliente dela -. E quais são as novas tecnologias para as quais o BC está olhando?
“Vejo a tokenização como tema mais importante para o sistema financeiro no momento. Há uma quantidade muito interessante de projetos trazendo ativos não financeiros para o sistema. São ideias importantes para o alargamento do perímetro regulatório e, por isso, o BC está apostando no Drex”.
O quanto a tecnologia influenciou as mudanças regulatórias: uma linha do tempo
Entre as regulamentações citadas por Damaso, diretor de regulação do Banco Central, uma delas tem a ver com o processo de aberturas de contas bancárias. No final de abril de 2016, uma nova norma passou a permitir que o processo de abertura de conta, poupança ou corrente, assim como seu fechamento, fosse realizado pela internet, sem a necessidade de ir a uma agência para apresentar a documentação necessária. A regulamentação do Conselho Monetário Nacional (CMN) foi anunciada como parte do programa Otimiza BC.
“Fomos um dos primeiros BCs do mundo a adotar uma norma com esse propósito. Foi um normativo fundamental para tudo que veio depois”, disse no evento paralelo ao G20, grupo de 19 países mais União Europeia e Africana, e que reúne no Rio de Janeiro reguladores, representantes de fintechs, bancos centrais e líderes financeiros.
Outro marco foi a lei das fintechs, que estão regulamentadas desde abril de 2018 pelo CMN sob as Resoluções 4.656 e 4.657.
“Ficou claro para as empresas que introduzem inovações nos mercados financeiros por meio do uso intenso de tecnologia que o BC seria um parceiro. A mudança de postura da autarquia, atendendo quem não pertencia àquele perímetro regulatório num primeiro momento, traz efeitos até hoje”, sustentou.
Por fim, Damaso citou o esforço para criar a regra de proporcionalidade entre as instituições financeiras. Com ela, as instituições têm regras de acordo com o seu porte e à sua complexidade. Hoje, os bancos incumbentes, ou seja, os maiores do mercado, são classificados como S1. As demais instituições se dividem entre S2, S3 e S4.
“Depois da crise global de 2008, o sistema financeiro nacional passou a fortalecer o arcabouço prudencial, com o foco em eliminar riscos. As recomendações de Basileia [as diretrizes para o capital bancário] se mostraram muito adequadas, mas funcionavam para as grandes instituições financeiras. Era necessário outro mecanismo”, lembrou. “Na época, houve receio de que os novos enquadramentos fossem entendidos como um relaxamento do sistema financeiro nacional, mas foram regulamentações bem recebidas e que abriram uma avenida para as instituições entrantes”, destacou."
"CDBs prefixados têm disparada nas taxas diante de aversão ao risco; veja quanto pagam
Publicidade
Enquanto o mercado opera com cautela, analisando se a atividade econômica dos Estados Unidos apresenta fraquezas, os bancos precisaram aumentar a taxa dos CDBs prefixados. Até o último dia 5, era possível encontrar ativos bancários pagando até 13,34%.
“Gosto dos títulos bancários por sua capacidade de oferecer maior previsibilidade à carteira”, diz Vinicius Romano, especialista em renda fixa da Suno Research. Já Leandro Ormond, analista da gestora de patrimônio Aware Investments, lembra que a remuneração desses papéis “geralmente tem um prêmio de risco em relação aos títulos públicos e eles ainda carregam a vantagem da proteção do FGC”.
Um levantamento feito pela Quantum Finance a pedido do InfoMoney mapeou as emissões de CDBs entre 22 de julho e 5 de agosto. A comparação com a quinzena anterior, de 5 a 19 de julho, mostrou alta expressiva nas taxas dos prefixados.
Os papéis com vencimento em dois anos pagaram, em média, 11,93% ao ano contra 11,08% na quinzena anterior. Já a remuneração dos prefixados de três anos subiu de 11,95% para 12,34%.
Ormond explica que a preocupação com a política fiscal e o cenário econômico incerto no exterior contribuíram para aumentar a percepção de risco na última quinzena. Consequentemente, o mercado pede mais prêmio para investir nos ativos com taxa fixa. “Se as expectativas de inflação seguirem desancoradas, é possível que o temor continue pairando no ar e as taxas continuem altas”, completa.
Nos vértices mais curtos, também houve altas importantes, com a taxa média em seis meses saindo de 9,93% para 10,11% e em um ano de 10,98% para 11,12%. Todas as taxas mínimas e altas subiram, assim como o número de títulos emitidos para cada vencimento, aumento o total de prefixados de 36 para 49.

CDBs pós-fixados
As taxas dos ativos bancários indexados ao CDI tiveram movimentos divergentes conforme o vencimento. Enquanto os papéis mais longos pagaram mais, houve queda na remuneração dos títulos mais curtos.
Nos papéis com vencimento em dois anos, a taxa média foi de 100,42% do CDI contra 99,88% na quinzena anterior. Já os títulos com prazo de seis meses tiveram um tombo na remuneração média, que caiu de 104,50% do CDI para 100,49%.
Romano explica que a expectativa de manutenção dos juros altos por mais tempo do que o previsto inicialmente pelo mercado impacta o custo de emissão para os bancos: “isso fez com que a remuneração em vencimentos mais curtos diminuísse, ajudando a equilibrar o passivo dos bancos”.

CBDs de inflação
Os bancos pisaram no freio na emissão de CDBs atrelados ao IPCA depois de uma sequência de aumento na emissão desses papéis. Mesmo assim, o volume segue expressivo, com 30 novos papéis.
Eles pagaram, em média, 6,17% além do IPCA nos vencimentos em dois anos, mais do que o juro real médio de 6,06% oferecido na quinzena anterior. Já os papéis de três anos tiveram queda na taxa média, de 6,10% para 5,98%."
"Barcelona receberá aporte de 100 mi de euros, diz site
Barcelona receberá aporte de 100 mi de euros, diz site
O pagamento substituirá 10% das ações do Barça Studios que o fundo Libero Football Finance havia concordado em adquirir em 2023
O FC Barcelona receberá um aporte financeiro de 100 milhões de euros (aproximadamente R$ 619 milhões) nesta 3ª feira (6.ago.2024). Segundo o programa Que t’hi Jugues da Cadena SER e o jornal SPORT, que citam fontes anônimas, pelo menos 40 milhões de euros (cerca de R$ 247 milhões) serão pagos ainda hoje.
Esse pagamento substituirá os 10% das ações do Barça Studios. A produtora é responsável pelo conteúdo audiovisual do clube. Inicialmente, o fundo alemão Libero Football Finance havia concordado em adquirir essas ações em 2023.
A Libero deveria ter feito 2 pagamentos de 40 milhões de euros (R$ 247 milhões) em outubro e mais 60 milhões de euros (R$ 370 milhões). No entanto, não cumpriu o acordo. Como resultado, o Barcelona enfrentou dificuldades para cumprir os limites do Fair Play Financeiro e registrar novos jogadores.
Com o novo acordo, o clube receberá 40 milhões de euros (R$ 247 milhões) imediatamente e mais 60 milhões de euros (R$ 370 milhões) em novembro. Esse aporte permitirá ao Barcelona cumprir a regra 1:1 do Fair Play Financeiro, que busca evitar que os times gastem mais do que arrecadam
Além disso, o SPORT revela que 3 patrocinadores estão por trás dessa injeção de dinheiro: Nike, Spotify e Aramark. A Nike fornece os uniformes, enquanto o Spotify –que também tem os naming rights do estádio Camp Nou– estampa as camisas e roupas de treino. A Aramark trabalha na reforma do Camp Nou.
Um dos patrocinadores assinará o acordo de 40 milhões de euros (R$ 247 milhões) nesta 3ª feira. O anúncio oficial está previsto para 4ª feira (7.ago.2024) e coincidirá com o retorno do time da turnê de pré-temporada pelos Estados Unidos, após enfrentar o Milan em Baltimore hoje as 20h30."
"Das quadras para o mercado: assessor acumula R$ 155 mi sob custódia aos 24 anos
Publicidade
O catarinense Rafael Bortolotti tem apenas 24 anos e já tem sob custódia um patrimônio de R$ 155 milhões. O rápido sucesso do assessor reforça a estratégia de formação de novos talentos, que tem ganhado força no mercado. Aliás, a presença deste jovem profissional no segmento se deve – indiretamente – a um outro incentivo que recebeu no passado.

Natural de Palmitos (SC), Bortolotti jogou vôlei dos oito aos dezessete anos, chegando a disputar campeonatos estaduais e conquistar títulos. No período, contava com o auxílio do Bolsa Atleta, programa do governo federal que oferece ajuda financeira para o treinamento de atletas de alto desempenho. No caso do hoje assessor de investimentos, o apoio serviu mais como um gatilho para o que seria a sua profissão no futuro.

“Antes de abandonar o vôlei, eu tinha um dinheiro guardado do Bolsa-Atleta e queria fazer alguma coisa para aquele recurso crescer”, relembra. “Fiz um curso sobre mercado financeiro, me interessei e isso foi o gatilho para ingressar nesta área”, conta.
Não seria para menos. Bortolotti conta que o primeiro investimento que fez foi nas ações da Weg (WEGE3), que carrega até hoje com um preço médio equivalente a R$ 9,27. Atualmente, o papel está cotado na casa dos R$ 46.
Estimulado pela ótima “jogada”, cursou administração, conseguiu o primeiro emprego e, mais tarde, em setembro de 2021, chegou a Nippur Finance, escritório em que construiu os números atuais sob custódia. O resultado, afirma, deve ser atribuído à formação inicial que recebeu na casa.

Pensando nesta demanda, a Nippur desenvolveu um modelo de formação e um plano de carreira que pode chegar a 36 meses, conta Vesoloski.
Segundo ele, o programa conta com mentorias e treinamento de habilidades técnicas, comerciais e até de autoconhecimento do assessor. Além disso, um suporte auxilia o profissional em momentos mais desafiadores, acrescenta.

"Open finance turbina super apps de bancos: o que você ganha com isso?
Mais da metade da população bancarizada não sabe o que é o open finance - mostra pesquisa encomendada pela Zetta, associação que representa fintechs. Mas, mesmo sem saber, em algum momento é bem provável que se depare com produtos e serviços financeiros que são criados ou melhorados a partir do sistema financeiro aberto. Um exemplo são os chamados “super apps”, que várias instituições estão desenvolvendo com a promessa de facilitar a vida financeira das pessoas.
- Faz pouco mais de três anos que o open finance foi criado pelo Banco Central e consiste numa grande estrutura, que une tecnologia e regulação, para permitir o compartilhamento de dados das pessoas com diferentes instituições financeiras, mesmo que não seja cliente delas.
- Com o open finance, determinadas informações, que antes eram conhecidas só por um banco passaram a ser disponibilizadas para outras instituições. E é desse grande banco de dados que os super apps estão sendo abastecidos, diz Otávio Damaso, diretor de regulação do BC.
“A instituição financeira quer que você use o app dela para acessar o sistema financeiro e, para isso, ela usa a plataforma do open finance para obter as informações dos clientes que estão na base de dados de diferentes bancos. Então, o open finance é pilar para os super apps existirem”, explica.
Mas o que é o super app?
“É o aplicativo que vai dar ao consumidor a liberdade para comprar e gerenciar todos os produtos que ele quiser num só lugar, seja qual for o banco, a fintech ou a empresa varejista que os estão ofertando. O usuário passa a usar um só canal para filtrar ofertas e escolher aquela que mais lhe entender enquanto consumidor. Esta é a grande mudança que vai acontecer”, resume Gueitiro Genso, especialista em serviços financeiros, que já foi vice-presidente de varejo do BB e CEO do PicPay.
Em termos práticos, isso significa dar adeus aos inúmeros aplicativos de bancos e cartões instalados no celular sem deixar de ter acesso aos serviços financeiros. E, considerando que o brasileiro tem em média seis contas abertas, muitos celulares vão recuperar alguns megabites de memória.
Isso, claro, representa apenas uma comodidade maior. Os ganhos, de fato, vão muito além e passam, principalmente, pela maior atenção ao usuário, diz Samuel Freire Jr, líder da área de open finance do Sistema Ailos, que congrega 13 cooperativas de crédito.
“Por muito tempo a competitividade entre os bancos foi baseada em quem tinha o melhor produto. Com as novas iniciativas do BC, ter um bom produto é uma obrigação pois os produtos de uma instituição poderão ser contratados no canal de outra e vice e versa”, diz. “Agora, a competitividade está cada vez mais sendo direcionada para a experiência do cliente, em construir uma jornada, fluída, rápida, segura e amigável. É isso que vai capturar o interesse do usuário e é para conquistar esse engajamento que os bancos estão competindo agora”.
Genso complementa dizendo que essa nova frente de competição entre os bancos - sobre quem entende melhor o potencial consumidor - abre caminho para que os usuários sejam atendidos em sua plenitude.
“A disputa é pela principalidade para que o cliente gerencie toda sua vida no aplicativo de uma determinada instituição. Como não há mais barreira de saída dos clientes, pois está muito mais fácil de trocar de banco, as instituições se veem pressionadas a organizar a base de dados para entender ao máximo o consumidor. Então o que as instituições estão fazendo agora é alimentar seus sistemas com os dados compartilhados para incluí-los em seus processos de negócio"".
Vale esclarecer que os super apps não dependem exclusivamente do open finance para existir. Já há no mercado aplicativos com ofertas e serviços financeiros integrados em um só lugar. Mas, mesmo esses aplicativos tendem a ganhar com o sistema financeiro aberto, diz Guilherme Assis, fundador da plataforma de consolidação de investimentos Gorila.
“Os super apps estão amadurecendo e aprimorando a experiência e as jornadas dos usuários e a evolução do open finance acelera e melhora ainda mais esses aplicativos. Com a integração do open finance, a jornada do cliente para a escolha e compra de produtos financeiros se torna muito mais personalizada, com produtos e serviços ajustados às necessidades individuais”, explica.
""Em resumo, o consumidor final se beneficia com uma oferta mais ampla e de maior qualidade devido à maior transparência e concorrência”, complementa Assis, que também é colunista no Valor Investe.
Não há uma data definida para que aplicativos com essa gama de informações cheguem ao mercado, afinal isso depende das instituições. Não é o BC quem vai desenvolvê-los. A autarquia apenas criou a infraestrutura para que ferramentas como essa se tornem possíveis. Por outro lado, os aplicativos para lá de eficientes não está tão longe de virar realidade, avalia Freire Jr, do Sistema Ailos.
“O desenvolvimento do open finance segue acelerados e duas funcionalidades que estão sendo debatidas poderão acelerar ainda mais os super apps: o consentimento único para autorizar o compartilhamento de dados e a efetivação das transações, e a jornada sem redirecionamento. Acreditamos que veremos isso no primeiro semestre de 2025."
"Cronograma da portabilidade do crédito no Open Finance está sendo desenvolvido por BC e CMN
Cronograma da portabilidade do crédito no Open Finance está sendo desenvolvido por BC e CMN
O Banco Central (BC) informou, por meio da sua assessoria de imprensa, que o cronograma de desenvolvimento da portabilidade de crédito via Open Finance está sendo deliberado pelo Conselho Monetário Nacional (CMN) e pela própria instituição.
Como mostrou a Coluna do Broadcast nesta quinta-feira, 25, o BC tem o objetivo de avançar neste tema e pretende estabelecer um grupo de trabalho com representantes de todas as associações que têm um assento na estrutura de governança do Open Finance para debater o tema este ano.
Nesta sexta-feira, 26, respondendo aos questionamentos da reportagem, a autoridade monetária afirmou que está realizando estudos sobre a portabilidade de crédito no Open Finance. O BC confirmou que um grupo de trabalho deve ser montado.
Sobre o Ressarcimento de Custos de Operação (RCO) - uma compensação que é paga pela instituição que ""atrai"" a operação àquela que a originou -, o BC disse não ter posicionamento. A Zetta, associação que representa empresas como o Nubank, tem como principal bandeira o fim dessa cobrança, mas os bancos tradicionais são contrários.

Em uma amostra das possibilidades de inovação permitidas pelas regras de securitização brasileiras, um novo tipo de operação deu origem a um certificado de recebível com lastro no mercado de criptomoedas e remuneração tentadora: até 43% ao ano.
A oferta, destinada ao investidor comum, é a primeira do tipo no mundo, segundo a plataforma de investimentos em ativos alternativos Hurst Capital e a empresa especializada em criptoativos Borum Finance, que estruturaram a operação. Mas, como é possível um retorno tão alto?
O título é ligado à expectativa de remuneração obtida no complexo mundo das finanças descentralizadas (DeFi). Na prática, a operação envolve depósito de criptoativos em uma plataforma de ativos digitais em troca de pagamento por fornecer liquidez nesse ambiente. As taxas obtidas no pool de liquidez são então revertidas para os detentores do recebível.
A remuneração de 43% está ligada às altas taxas pagas por plataformas de ativos digitais que trabalham com pools de liquidez, que funcionam como cestas que reúnem vários criptoativos em um mesmo lugar. “Eles permitem a troca de criptoativos de forma descentralizada, e os investidores fornecem pares de tokens a uma exchange descentralizada e recebem parte das taxas de transação geradas”, explica o head de criptomoedas da Hurst Capital, Francis Wagner.
O risco de ataque hacker é um dos envolvidos no uso de exchanges descentralizadas. Como meio de proteção, Wagner explica que a operação considera apenas os protocolos DeFi identificados como seguros por um estudo de governança, e que as criptos serão guardadas em carteiras físicas para minimizar perigos. E se a segurança de uma das plataformas utilizadas ainda assim for quebrada, há previsão de oferta de recompensas para recuperar os valores, no caso de ataque benigno (white hat).
Antes de serem pagos aos investidores, os rendimentos do pool serão convertidos em stablecoins (criptomoedas estáveis) indexadas ao dólar. De acordo com com a lâmina do produto, essa estratégia permite que a alocação do investidor fique protegida da oscilação do mercado cripto. No entanto, oferece exposição cambial.

O prazo da operação é de 60 meses, com um payback (tempo de retorno de um investimento) estimado em 33 meses.
É legal?
O novo produto financeiro é distribuído via oferta pública simplificada de Certificado de Recebíveis com base na resolução CVM 88, que trata das operações de crowdfunding. A Hurst é uma das plataformas registradas no regulador. Assim como outras ofertas realizadas via crowdfunding, o recebível pode ser ofertado para investidores, inclusive os de varejo, sem necessidade de avaliação por parte da Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM).
A CVM divulgou recentemente que, em 2022, o país tinha 60 plataformas captando recursos por meio dessa modalidade específica. Juntas, elas conseguiram atrair um volume de R$ 131 milhões naquele ano, com o valor médio de captação por oferta na casa dos R$ 1.580.000.

A integração entre as finanças tradicionais e a indústria de criptomoedas costuma render operações inusitadas. Até o início deste ano, as empresas brasileiras tokenizaram mais de R$ 1 bilhão, inclusive ofertas de motéis. Neste semana, surgiu também o primeiro FIDC focado na aquisição de direitos creditórios digitais."

"Why does India remain a ‘price taker’ in the global metals market?
The copper market has experienced significant volatility due to macroeconomic factors, particularly China’s influence and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policies. With China consuming nearly 50 per cent of global copper production, its economic health, especially in the housing sector, heavily influences copper prices. In this State of the Economy podcast,businessline’s Subramani Ra Mancombu speaks to Kishore Narne, Director & Head - Commodity & Currency - Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker Pvt Ltd, on the factors influencing copper pricing.
Initially, expectations of a Chinese economic stimulus and U.S. rate cuts spurred copper prices. However, the absence of such actions from both countries led to a downturn in copper prices. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates and China’s lack of significant economic announcements disappointed the market, leading to a rally in the U.S. dollar and a subsequent fall in copper prices.
Looking ahead, several factors will shape copper prices. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s approach to interest rates and the potential for a soft economic landing in the U.S. are crucial. Recent U.S. economic indicators suggest cooling inflation and rising unemployment, making a rate cut more likely in the near future. However, China’s economic recovery remains uncertain, and its weak demand for copper may limit any price increases.
Additionally, the low treatment and refining charges (TCRC) and increasing copper inventories indicate a mismatch between supply and demand. While smelters continue to produce copper, low end-consumer demand may eventually force them to reduce output, negatively impacting copper prices.
Other potential influences include the possibility of a deeper U.S. recession and the shift by some Chinese government agencies from copper to aluminum in infrastructure projects. However, the distinct properties and uses of copper and aluminum limit their interchangeability. In India, the copper market is more affected by global prices as India is a price taker rather than a price maker. Despite this, India’s ongoing infrastructure development and electric vehicle growth will continue to drive copper demand.

Furthermore, the project has demonstrated it can operate at near design capacity with gradual improvements to quality We are prioritizing consistent production volumes at these higher rates which should continue to bring down costs. These operational efforts, coupled with effective cost management through disciplined spending, optimized working capital, and a strong financial position are crucial to ensuring our success today and in the future.”
Mr. Pigott continued by saying, “I am incredibly proud of our hardworking and dedicated team at our lithium operation in Argentina and our team in North America. Their commitment and expertise have been instrumental in achieving our goals and navigating challenges in an efficient manner.

In Q2 2024, net income was primarily due to recognition of deferred tax recovery of $10.8 million caused by an inflation adjustment on the tax basis of Pastos Grandes assets in Argentina, gain on change in fair value of the convertible note derivative liability and finance income partially offset by expenses in the period.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, total assets decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents which were used to fund the Company’s operations and a decrease in investment in the Caucharí-Olaroz project due the Company’s share of loss of the Cauchari-Olaroz Project, partially offset by an increase in loans advanced to Exar Capital.
This news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Argentina’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which are available on SEDAR+. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.

"ASX hit with court action over core replacement status updates
ASX’s ill-fated attempt to re-platform its core trading system on distributed ledger technology has landed it in trouble with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
ASIC said it has filed Federal Court proceedings against ASX for statements that the market operator made as to the project’s progress and technology’s readiness.
Specifically, ASIC alleges statements that the project remained “on-track for go-live” and was “progressing well” were misleading.
“Companies and market participants rely on what the ASX says about its operations to make their own decisions and investments,” ASIC chair Joe Longo said in a statement.
“We expect the ASX to be a place to list and invest with confidence.
“When the ASX falls short, it has wide ranging consequences across the market.”
Longo said the “critical importance” of the core replacement project should have been “all the more reason ASX needed to ensure it told the Australian public the truth about how the project was tracking and whether it would be completed on time.”
ASX abandoned a distributed ledger-based replacement of its core trading system in November 2022 due to project management issues, as well as technical and scalability concerns, but not before the broader finance sector had sunk considerable time and money into supporting it.
It still intends to replace the system, but has gone back to the drawing board for a new approach.
The exchange last year committed to “lift transparency” in the way the replacement program progressed.
https://www.itnews.com.au/news/asx-concedes-it-must-lift-transparency-on-core-replacement-591258
ASIC said it is “yet to determine the penalty it will seek for ASX's alleged contraventions.”"
"Ministry tasked with turning the tide
Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has directed Commerce Minister Phumtham Wechayachai to expedite measures this month to address the influx of Chinese goods into Thailand.
Speaking after the weekly cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, Mr Srettha said the cabinet had instructed the Commerce Ministry to take the lead in determining measures to prevent and suppress substandard goods produced in other countries from entering Thailand.
This task will be carried out in collaboration with other agencies, including the Finance Ministry, the Digital Economy and Society Ministry, the Industry Ministry, the Public Health Ministry, and the Royal Thai Police. The goal is to support small Thai businesses in adapting and competing in both offline and online markets, with the relevant measures to be proposed by the end of August.
Government spokesman Chai Wacharonke said complaints from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) about abnormal trade practices by foreign businesses selling goods online and offline in Thailand led the premier to request Mr Phumtham to lead discussions with relevant agencies to establish clear and concrete measures, while supporting Thai SME in their efforts to adapt and compete in both online markets and offline in retail stores.
""There have been growing complaints from the [Thai] private sector about illegal 'grey' businesses. These businesses have affected SMEs that are impacted by e-commerce, both online and offline. It was found that there has been an unusually high influx of imported goods, with the e-commerce business valued at up to 1.53 trillion baht,"" said Mr Chai.
""The prime minister then ordered the Commerce Ministry to take the lead in coordinating this matter, which will involve checking business licences and ensuring businesses are properly registered as legal entities.""
He said there will be inspections concerning product standards, including both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industrial product standards, to protect Thai consumers.
The Consumer Protection Board will coordinate with the FDA, and there will also be checks on import licences to ensure import taxes and duties are paid in accordance with the law. Measures will also include factory establishment permits, with a focus on balancing and considering international trade agreements, Mr Chai said.
He said the Commerce Ministry is currently considering appropriate measures and has found that China currently has measures in place for e-commerce, such as limiting the number of imported items that can be purchased online per year and setting a maximum annual purchase value.
For imports, there is currently a 7% value-added tax (VAT) charged in Thailand on imported goods worth 1-1,500 baht, with additional VAT and import duties on items valued between 1,500-40,000 baht. Items valued above 40,000 baht are taxed according to the product classification.
In a related development, Mr Phumtham has a post on his personal Facebook page about the arrival of Temu, a major Chinese platform that sells cheap products directly from Chinese manufacturers without intermediaries. He noted that while it presents both opportunities and challenges, Temu's entry into Thailand is an interesting phenomenon that significantly impacts SMEs, as it is a large e-commerce platform with high competitive potential.
To prevent the import of substandard or dangerous products and to ensure fair competition, the government is nevertheless considering e-commerce tax measures to ensure international platforms are taxed appropriately and do not harm the Thai economy, he said."

"Eir, Ryanair and Sky most likely to be referenced by callers as consumer complaints rise 18%
Complaints to Ireland’s consumer watchdog jumped sharply in the first half of the year, with telecoms operator Eir and Ryanair the two companies most likely to be referenced by callers to its helpline.
According to the new report from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), published this Wednesday, queries and complaints from the public increased by 18 per cent between January and June when compared with the same period in 2023.
More than 20,000 contacts were managed by the watchdog which is calling for legislative changes to give it the power to impose larger fines for serious offences, including fines that represent a percentage of a business’s turnover.
Eir was the company most frequently identified by callers to the CCPC helpline, with the company being referenced by 356 of those who made contact, followed by Ryanair on 269. In third place was Sky with 254 contacts, followed by Vodafone which was mentioned by 239 callers, while Harvey Norman was in fifth place on 234.

The other companies rounding out the top 10 were Currys, Virgin, Aer Lingus, Power City and Lidl.
Earlier this year Eir was labelled a “disgrace” by a District Court judge after a court heard evidence that the telecom provider warned staff they could be disciplined for adhering to statutory regulations governing customer complaints. In the case taken by ComReg, Eir and its parent company Eircom pleaded guilty to multiple breaches of the law over its failure to acknowledge customer complaints and provide responses within 10 working days among other issues. The company was fined €750 for each of 10 counts before the court.
[ Consumers being denied access to redress routes because of outdated rules, watchdog says ]
Of the top five sectors the CCPC was contacted about between January and June, vehicles and transport topped the list, generating 2,904 contacts. Telecommunications operations were responsible for 1,534 contacts, followed by home building and improvements on 1,228. Holidays and travel issues prompted 1,110 contacts, followed by clothing, footwear and accessories on 1,018.
The report also reveals that 1,990 consumers contacted the CCPC with a question about personal finance.
There were notable increases in consumer contacts relating to motor insurance and loans, while the page on PCPs (Personal Contract Plans) was the most-visited personal finance page on the CCPC website in the first half of this year.
“Whether you’re buying a birthday card or a brand-new car you have rights as a consumer, and the trader you’re buying from has certain responsibilities under the law,” said the CCPC’s director of communications Grainne Griffin.
“It can be tricky for consumers to understand their rights when something breaks down or a delivery doesn’t show up, and that’s where the CCPC can help. An informed consumer is an empowered consumer, and knowing your rights can make life easier when things go wrong.”
Ms Griffin expressed concern about access to the Small Claims Court, and said many callers, including car buyers and those contacting the CCPC about issues with home improvements, “are automatically excluded from this option due to the low claim limit”. She also called for the toughening up of other laws.
She said “unscrupulous traders who rip off consumers make it harder for law-abiding businesses to survive”.
“We’ll use all the powers available to us, up to and including prosecution, to detect and penalise lawbreakers. However, we know that the level of fines issued for breaches of consumer protection law is not always a deterrent, especially for large businesses. Changes to the law are needed to give the CCPC the power to impose larger fines for serious offences, for example fines that are a percentage of a business’s turnover.”

"Azets to double its corporate finance team
Accountancy firm Azets Ireland is planning to double the size of its corporate finance team in the Republic, positioning itself to exploit an expected boom in mid-market merger and acquisition (M&A) activity over the coming years as interest rates begin to fall.
On Wednesday the firm said it had named former Mazars corporate finance director David Lucas to head the division and lead the expansion.
Most recently, Mr Lucas served as corporate finance partner at PKF O’Connor, Leddy and Holmes, the rival Dublin-based accountancy firm that agreed to merge with Azets earlier this year. The enlarged firm is headed by Azets chief executive Neil Hughes and chaired by Donal O’Leary, former managing partner in PKF O’Connor, Leddy & Holmes.
Azets, a London-based accounting, audit and advisory group, entered the Irish market more than a year ago with the purchase of Baker Tilly Ireland, where Mr Hughes was in charge.
The firm is now in expansion mode against a backdrop of growing interest in Irish companies as M&A targets. Although deal-making activity is down compared with last year, the market picked up in the second quarter and analysts expect softening inflation and falling interest rates to further stimulate activity into the second half and beyond.
Mr Lucas said the move came at an exciting time for Azets as it expands its operations here against a promising market backdrop. “The expected reduction in interest rates is likely to boost deal activity in the short to medium term while there is growing interest in Irish businesses from international as well as domestic trade and private equity buyers,” he said.
The firm, which employs 260 people at offices in Dublin, Wexford and Waterford, said the Irish M&A market had outperformed the global market in recent years with private equity deals up 30 per cent in the first quarter of 2024 alone. The firm wants to add 20 new recruits to its 16-person corporate finance team over the next three years to capitalise on these conditions, enabling it to advise companies on a growing number of transactions.
Hailing Mr Lucas as an “ideal leader” to drive the firm’s corporate finance expansion plan, Mr Hughes said the group was poised for near-term growth. “As Azets continues its growth journey both in Ireland and internationally, we see this role as critical in leading the delivery of the specialist corporate finance services that our entrepreneurial client base needs,” he said.
There were 108 mergers and acquisitions involving Irish companies in the second quarter of this year, stockbrokers Davy said earlier this week, 21 per cent ahead of the 89 transactions completed in the preceding three months.

MESSAGE FROM CONDOR’S CEO
Don Streu, President and CEO of Condor commented: “Since assuming the Uzbekistan field operations on March 1, 2024, the team has arrested a twenty percent natural production decline rate while initiating a multi-well workover program to grow production and reserves volumes. We’re encouraged with the early gains we’ve realized by implementing proven technologies and operating practices. The first well workover yielded over a 100 percent production rate increase compared to its pre-workover rate. With more than 100 existing wells on the eight producing fields, we have a large inventory of enhancement opportunities and are working to increase production volumes and revenues beyond the second quarter of 2024 operating results. We are also excited to receive a reprocessed 3-D seismic data set this year to improve subsurface imaging that could identify additional well interventions and future infill and multi-lateral drilling programs.
We are equally excited with our first-mover LNG initiative in Kazakhstan, given that we’ve secured the feed gas supply for the first liquefaction facility and executed the Framework Agreement with KTZ and Wabtec, which introduces Condor as the LNG supplier and distributor. By applying field proven technologies to displace diesel fuel usage with LNG, end users can expect to reduce emissions and operating costs while increasing operating ranges with faster freight delivery times.
Over the past few years, we’ve truly built a strong foundation for continued growth with multiple near-term catalysts that are being actively matured.”
Production in Uzbekistan
Production for the second quarter of 2024 was 10,052 boe/d, comprised of 59,033 Mcf/d (9,839 boe/d) of natural gas and 213 bopd of condensate, despite production being restricted in April and May for 18 days due to downstream infrastructure maintenance at non-Company operated facilities. Since assuming operations on March 1, 2024, the Company has been able to flatten the natural production decline rates, which previously exceeded twenty percent annually, by introducing downhole surfactants that allows produced water to be lifted more effectively, optimizing well choke-size settings, implementing facility upgrades, and introducing new operating methodologies.
In late June 2024, the Company initiated a multi-well workover campaign for the eight fields which includes installing proven artificial lift equipment, perforating newly identified pay intervals, performing downhole stimulation treatments, and production tubing replacements. The first well’s production rate increased by over 100% compared to its pre-workover rate. Subsequent wells that have been worked-over are being cleaned up and restarted. The workover program is ongoing and with over 100 wells in the eight fields, the Company has a large inventory of both producing and shut-in wells available for evaluation, recompletion and optimization opportunities.
The Company recently fabricated Uzbekistan’s first in-line flow separation unit which separates water from the gas streams at the field gathering network rather than at the production facility and thereby reducing pipeline flow pressure that can lead to higher reservoir flow rates. This separation unit was manufactured in Canada and is expected to be operational in the third quarter of 2024. Additional separation units will be manufactured and installed in the coming months. The existing pipeline and facilities infrastructure are also being evaluated to optimize water-handling, determine long term field compression requirements, and to enhance in-field gathering networks. The Company is also reprocessing previously acquired 3-D seismic data with plans to conduct infill drilling and well deepening programs commencing in 2025. Production guidance will be provided by the Company once it has gathered sufficient operating data to confirm the fields’ baseline production, decline rates and the sustained impact of the ongoing workover program along with other optimization efforts that are being introduced.
LNG in Kazakhstan
Condor is developing Kazakhstan’s first LNG facilities and will produce, distribute, and sell LNG to offset industrial diesel usage. LNG applications include rail locomotives, long-haul truck fleets, marine vessels, mining equipment, municipal bus fleets, agricultural machinery, and other heavy equipment and machinery with high-horsepower engines. These applications have all successfully used LNG fuel in other Countries.
In July 2024, the Company signed its first LNG Framework Agreement (the “Framework Agreement”) for the production and utilization of LNG to fuel Kazakhstan’s rail locomotives. The Framework Agreement was also signed by Kazakhstan Temir Zholy National Company JSC (“KTZ”), the national railway operator of Kazakhstan and Wabtec Corporation (“Wabtec”) (NYSE: WAB), a U.S. based locomotive manufacturer with existing facilities in Kazakhstan. KTZ and Wabtec previously signed a memorandum of understanding which includes modernization work to retrofit KTZ’s mainline locomotive fleet for LNG usage and incorporate LNG into new-build locomotives. The Framework Agreement introduces Condor into this locomotive fleet modernization strategy as the supplier and distributor of the LNG.
The Framework Agreement also provides a detailed framework whereby the three parties will coordinate efforts to ensure that Condor’s LNG production volumes coincide with the delivery of new and converted LNG-powered rail locomotives from Wabtec. A working group comprised of members from each of the parties is responsible to identify and monitor the key performance indicators associated with this initiative.
The Framework Agreement is critical to supplying a stable, economic and more environmentally friendly fuel source for the Transcaspian International Transport Route (“TITR”) expansion, which is currently the shortest, fastest and most geopolitically secure transit corridor for moving freight between Asia and Europe. The Government of Kazakhstan and KTZ are making significant investments in TITR infrastructure, including expanding the rail network, constructing a new dry port at the Kazakhstan – China border, and increasing the container-handling capacities at various Caspian Sea ports.
The planned first modular LNG facility will be constructed near the town of Alga and produce 120,000 metric tons of LNG annually, which is the energy equivalent volume of 450,000 litres of diesel per day. Phase 1 of the first facility is currently scheduled to commence LNG production in mid-2026, for which a stable feed gas supply was secured in January 2024. The Company is also advancing project funding alternatives.
Lithium License in Kazakhstan
The Company holds a 100% working interest in the contiguous 37,300-hectare area which provides the subsurface exploration rights for solid minerals for a six-year term (the “Lithium License”). Given its strategic access to Asian and European lithium markets, this region is ideally suited for the rapid deployment of emerging Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) technologies to generate lithium for EV batteries and other electricity storage applications.
The initial development plan for the Lithium License includes drilling and testing two wells to verify deliverability rates, confirm the lateral extension and concentrations of lithium in the tested and untested intervals, conduct preliminary engineering for the production facilities, and prepare a mineral resources or mineral reserves report compliant with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.
Convertible Debentures
On March 22, 2024, the Company issued convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) convertible into 2,950,336 common shares for gross proceeds of USD $4.8 million (CAD $6.5 million) less debt issue costs of CAD $0.2 million for net proceeds of CAD $6.3 million. The Debentures are unsecured, bear interest at 9% payable in cash semi-annually in arrears, mature in three years, and the principal amount is convertible at any time on or before the maturity date at a conversion price of USD $1.61676 per common share. The Company can force conversion of the Debentures if the 20-day volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s shares on the TSX exceeds CAD $3.00. The proceeds are available for general corporate purposes. The Debentures have no associated financial covenants.

BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT ADVISORY
References herein to barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) are derived by converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand standard cubic feet (“Mcf”) of gas to one barrel of oil based on an energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 Mcf to 1 barrel, utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 Mcf to 1 barrel may be misleading as an indication of value, particularly if used in isolation.

"Global Outrage Over Far-Right Israeli Minister's Prayer At Al-Aqsa Mosque
Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers.
Jerusalem: A far-right Israeli minister drew international condemnation Tuesday by praying with thousands of Jews at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site.
National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to ""defeat Hamas"" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.
The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.
The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.
Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ben Gvir showed ""blatant disregard"" for the status quo at the site and urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent such actions.
""These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a (Gaza) ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,"" he said.
Days earlier the White House used strong language to call out another far-right member of Netanyahu's cabinet, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who criticized President Joe Biden's push for a Gaza ceasefire.
In recent years, the restrictions at the compound have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.
On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site, told AFP.
Israeli police also ""imposed restrictions"" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.
""Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque,"" the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.
- 'Unduly provocative' -
Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the ""storming"" of the mosque, calling it a ""flagrant violation of international law"".
""The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations,"" ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, ""strongly condemned"" the incident and said it was a ""provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world"".
Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was ""against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites"".
""This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative,"" he added.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc ""strongly condemns the provocations"" by Ben Gvir.
France's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""This new provocation is unacceptable.""
Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.
Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.
""We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo,"" he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.
""We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees,"" Ben Gvir said.
Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.

"Wisconsin GOP Senate Candidate Sues TV Stations Over Dem Ad Blitz
Wisconsin Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde has launched a lawsuit against several Wisconsin television stations and a Democratic Party aligned PAC for running ads that he claims defamed him.
The ad states that Hovde, the CEO and chairman of the board for Sunwest Bank, and his family “rigged the system to rake in $30 million in government subsidies and loans, and now he’s sheltering his wealth in shady tax havens around the world.” It also claims at one point that Hovde is a “California banker.”
The ad was cut by WinSenate PAC. The outfit is one of the defendants named in the suit, along with Gray Media Group, Nexstar Media, Inc., The Evening Telegram Company, Sinclair Communications, LLC, Fox Television Stations, LLC, ION Media Networks, Inc. and Scripps Media, Inc., according to an Aug. 9 filing.
Attorneys for Hovde sent letters to the defendants on June 14, to “immediately remove this false advertisement from your network in accordance with your obligations and duties as an FCC licensee,” according to one letter obtained by Wisconsin Public Radio.
“The advertisement opens with the false claim that Mr. Hovde is a ‘California banker.’ This is not true,” the letter went on. Hovde’s Sunwest Bank is a subsidiary of the Irvine, California-based H Bancorp, although he resides in Madison, Wisconsin, according to the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal.
Attorneys for Hovde also took issue with the claim that Hovde “now is sheltering his wealth in shady tax havens around the world,” writing in the letter that the claim “is both false and defamatory in that it accuses Mr. Hovde of tax evasion with no evidence to support the allegations made.”
“We request that you comply with the requirements imposed on your station under the law and decline to further air the ‘WinSenate’ advertisement on the grounds that it contains false and misleading claims. Any future airings would be done so with reckless disregard of the advertisement’s falsity,” the letter concludes.
Attorneys representing WinSenate sent a follow-up letter on June 17 stating, “there is absolutely nothing false about the claims in this advertisement. The Campaign has no right to silence WinSenate. Your decision to accept the advertisement should remain undisturbed.”
Senior Director for Campaign Finance at the Campaign Legal Center Erin Chlopak told WPR that Hovde’s suit had few legs to stand on “as a general matter, false statements in campaign ads are protected,” due to Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus 2014.
Representatives for the Hovde campaign and WinSenate did not respond to the Daily Beast’s request for comment at the time of publishing."
"Will bitcoin become a strategic reserve asset for the U.S.?
Will bitcoin become a strategic reserve asset for the U.S.?
As bitcoin continues to gain traction among institutional players, the question of its future role in the U.S. is becoming increasingly pressing.
Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson and John Divine, Head of OTC Trading at BlockFills, recently discussed the potential for bitcoin to evolve into a strategic reserve asset, a development that could redefine the economic landscape. This critical shift raises questions about the speed at which this transformation could occur and the challenges that may arise from political resistance.
Nelson sparked the discussion by questioning whether bitcoin's integration into the U.S. reserve currency is inevitable. He pointed out that despite media narratives, the market is showing clear signs of embracing bitcoin, with more institutions, banks, and companies incorporating it into their strategies. Nelson's observations suggest that the momentum behind bitcoin is building, making it increasingly difficult to ignore its economic significance.
At the Bitcoin Conference last month, former President Trump announced his intention to create a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve if he is reelected. So far, Vice President Kamala Harris has not shared a similar sentiment.
Divine shared Nelson's perspective, agreeing that bitcoin is on a path to becoming a key asset for the U.S. government. However, Divine emphasized that the speed at which this transition happens could be influenced by upcoming political events. He expressed concern that certain political factions, particularly on the left, may resist bitcoin's integration, given its alignment with sound money principles that contrast with recent fiscal policies.
Divine highlighted that these sound money principles, which bitcoin represents, stand in opposition to the policy decisions of the past few years, particularly those that have contributed to the nation's growing debt. He warned that this ideological divide might lead to efforts to keep bitcoin out of the political conversation, potentially stalling its adoption as a reserve asset."
"More 'universal' DWP payments scrapped and will cost people £300
Scotland has scrapped ""universal"" Winter Fuel Payments and followed the new Labour Party government and Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) lead and prepares for more cuts. Shona Robison, Scotland’s finance secretary, accused the UK government of preparing for austerity by stealth after she ordered civil servants to rein back on all non-essential spending.
Robison said the decision to axe the £160m winter fuel payment for all pensioners had been forced by Reeves’s announcement that the same benefit was being withdrawn in other parts of the UK. “You cannot make £22bn of cuts without consequences,” Robison said. “This is going to be a really, really tough year,” she added. She refused to confirm whether it would involve cuts to free school meals or other benefits.
“It really frustrates me, because I know about the levels of fuel poverty, in an energy-rich country, but because of the constraints of devolution and this unexpected cut, we are not able to deliver what we wanted to deliver.” She issued a letter to Scottish government officials ordering “emergency controls” on spending.

David Phillips, an IFS associate director, said that would matter a great deal if Scotland were independent or had greater fiscal autonomy. “Under current constitutional arrangements, such differences matter little: Scotland’s notional deficit is subsumed within the wider UK’s deficit,” he said.
Kirsty McNeill, the recently appointed Scotland minister for the UK government, and a former executive with Save the Children, said the Gers data “underlined the collective economic strength of the United Kingdom”.
And McNeill said the UK government wanted to collaborate with Scottish ministers. “We have reset relationships with partners across the UK, and want to work closely with the Scottish government to produce better results for people in Scotland,” she said in a statement today.
It follows the axe of Winter Fuel Payments for England households last week."
"'Sheriff of Silicon Valley': How Kamala Harris's tenure as California AG could shape her approach to Big Tech
'Sheriff of Silicon Valley': How Kamala Harris's tenure as California AG could shape her approach to Big Tech
During Kamala Harris’s stint as California’s top prosecutor, few knew her better than Travis LeBlanc — the special assistant attorney general of California and one of her most senior advisers.
While working for Harris, LeBlanc’s responsibilities included tech regulation, cybersecurity, privacy, and antitrust. Yahoo Finance spoke to LeBlanc exclusively about Harris's moves during her tenure from 2011 to 2017, including her business track record and pro-growth approach to tech companies.
“She is mindful that there are large players and small players in tech, and those aren't the same,” LeBlanc said. “One of the biggest concerns is that disruptors are given an opportunity to succeed, and that they aren't squelched by either an incumbent or a very large player in the market before they've had a chance to flourish.”
Insight into a Harris administration
Last week, the US Dept. of Justice ruled that Google (GOOGL, GOOG) violated an antitrust law with its search business. The ruling, a major victory for the Biden administration, could serve as a template for future cases. However, Harris has so far stayed silent on what an antitrust environment would look like if she were elected president.
LeBlanc said one of Harris's biggest goals has always been “giving disruptors an opportunity to compete, recognizing that the incentives of incumbents and larger companies may be to use the power of the government to help exclude them from competing in the marketplace.”
In 2012, Harris sued and reached a $3.75 million settlement with eBay (EBAY) over allegations the company violated anti-competitive laws regarding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit.
One of the biggest antitrust cases Harris handled came in late 2011 when she successfully blocked AT&T’s buyout of T-Mobile’s US operations. At the time, Harris joined 10 other states that banded together following several meetings with AT&T's leadership.
“That was a very big deal,” LeBlanc said. “T-Mobile used that to become the T-Mobile that we know of today. They now compete directly with AT&T and Verizon.”
While her prosecutorial record in California provides some hints on how she would run the country, LeBlanc and several former staffers Yahoo Finance spoke to describe Harris as an effective communicator who wouldn’t always use litigation as a tool.
One of Harris's key accomplishments as attorney general was in 2012 when her office reached an agreement with six tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google, Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ), and Research In Motion, requiring the companies to include clear privacy policies for users before they downloaded apps.
“I can't imagine that today those companies would all sign an agreement with any attorney general or department of justice,” LeBlanc said. “It was a real testament to her ability to convene, to work with the stakeholders, and to try and achieve a resolution that would benefit everyone.”
As vice president, Harris has played a key role in the Biden administration’s efforts around artificial intelligence.
“President Biden and I reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation,” Harris said at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London last year. “We can and we must do both.”
LeBlanc said a Harris administration would likely continue parts of Biden’s AI policies, adding she will “be mindful that the technology is evolving, and if we're going to regulate it, we need to do so in a way that’s nimble, so that we don't end up impeding the progress of technology in the future in ways that no one intended today.”
Big Tech vs the FTC
When Harris was running to become California’s attorney general in 2010, wealthy supporters included Salesforce (CRM)’s Marc Benioff, Apple’s Jony Ive, Meta (META)’s Sheryl Sandberg, and the wife of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs (who is also the founder and president of Emerson Collective).
On Sunday, Harris returned to the city where her political career began for a fundraiser. It was her first trip back to San Francisco since rising to the top of the Democratic ticket. “This is a room full of dear, dear, dear friends,” Harris said to the gathering of Silicon Valley elites. She raised $13 million that day.
The pro-Harris movement in tech includes donations and endorsements from Netflix (NFLX)’s Reed Hastings, Sheryl Sandberg, Box (BOX)’s Aaron Levie, Khosla Venture's Vinod Khosla, and Melinda French Gates, among others.
But Harris faces a delicate balance between appeasing her donors and regulating the tech industry. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who donated $7 million to her campaign, told CNN last month that if Harris is elected she should replace Lina Khan, head of the Federal Trade Commission.
Khan’s term expires in September and her future as FTC chair remains unknown. Hoffman sits on the board of Microsoft — a company with a history of clashing with the FTC. According to Hoffman, Harris should elect a new antitrust chief, as Khan is “waging a war on American business.”
When asked if Hoffman or the opinion of her deep-pocketed tech donors would impact Harris's decision on who should lead the FTC, LeBlanc said, “I think she will ultimately make any personnel decisions based on who she thinks is the right person for the job.”
Former staffers say Harris helped shape Silicon Valley — and Silicon Valley shaped Harris, who once campaigned on being the “sheriff of Silicon Valley.” It remains to be seen if she will have the same moniker if she’s elected commander in chief.

TV chef picks best cheap eats in London
Every Wednesday we ask top chefs to pick their favourite Cheap Eats where they live and when they cook at home. This week we speak to TV chef Judy Joo, who co-owns the popular Seoul Bird in London.
Hi Judy, can you tell us your favourite places in London where you can get a meal for two for less than £40?
Since 1900, Paul Rothe & Son in Marylebone has been crafting some of the best sandwiches in London. Lucky for me, I live just around the corner from this charming, historic deli.
My go-to is their famous pastrami and cheese, piled high with pickle, mayo, and mustard. Occasionally, I'll switch things up with their epic coronation chicken, or if I'm feeling adventurous, a jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn. It's quintessentially British, and I love it.
Trejo's Tacos has crossed the pond, opening its first international outpost in Notting Hill. Founded by actor Danny Trejo, this canteen boasts a cult following in Los Angeles (myself included) and has quickly become my favourite spot for tacos in London.
My usual order includes a plate of Baja fish and spicy shrimp tacos, dosed in their house hot sauce and perfectly complemented by one of their stellar OG margaritas or homemade horchata. I also love their house-made guacamole and salsa served with their truly addictive freshly fried corn tortilla chips. I just munch away while thinking of the southern California sun.
I live near Edgware Road, an area renowned for its vibrant Middle Eastern community and fantastic cuisine. Maroush, a London institution with multiple venues across the city, remains a favourite, especially the original one on Edgware Road.
The chicken or lamb shawarma is the star dish, slow-cooked on vertical rotisseries, infused with aromatic spices, and expertly sliced off with sabers. It's the perfect late-night snack after a few too many pints. I love their tomato okra stew with rice - so comforting and warming.
Tucked away in the basement of an unassuming British pub down a quaint mews street in Marylebone is Liu Xiaomian.
I usually order the minced pork xiaomian - toothsome wheat noodles swimming in a red chilli broth, then dressed with seasoned pork and fragrant spring onions. The numbing pork wontons are another standout, delivering what their name promises in true mala style. Don't miss the cucumber side salad which offers a refreshing respite for your palate.
What is your go-to cheap eat to cook at home when you have a night in?
My go-to budget-friendly meal for cooking at home is pimped-out instant ramen noodles.
If I am feeling spicy, I'll grab a pack of Shin Ramen and add fresh veggies and leftover proteins from the fridge.
Spinach, mushrooms, corn, spring onions, leftover roasted chicken, and some frozen dumplings usually make their way into the pot. Absolutely anything goes!
And, to finish, I'll crack an egg in and let it cook on top of the noodles just until the yolk is set, but still gooey. It's a quick, delicious meal that hits the spot every time.

"Martin Lewis warns drivers who've received £3,345 'out of the blue'
Martin Lewis has issued a warning to drivers after motorists bag THOUSANDS ""out of the blue"". The Money Saving Expert team, which was founded by BBC and ITV star Mr Lewis, have shared a guide to financial compensation in the wake of the car finance mis-selling scandal.
MSE said: ""Some MoneySavers have reported receiving car finance mis-selling compensation payments out of the blue. But these are unrelated to the latest ongoing investigation into hidden commission, which means you CAN still complain about that on top.""
One reader, Andrew, got £3,345 back In compensation. MSE said: ""In one letter we've seen, which has been verified by Black Horse, the lender made a payout for an administrative error, which meant the borrower had been charged more interest than they should have done when extending the term of their motor finance agreement.

""Motonovo hasn't explained why some may have received payments, only confirming that it's not making any goodwill payments related to the FCA's investigation into historic motor finance commissions. Meanwhile, VW Financial Services told us it is proactively contacting current and former customers who might have experienced repayment difficulties and may not have received good levels of service.""
The FCA is currently investigating whether car finance lenders mis-sold to consumers by using hidden 'discretionary commission' arrangements. This is where lenders allowed brokers and car dealers to up the interest on car finance agreements to increase their commission – so you overpaid, without knowing.
The FCA has extended the period of time motor finance firms can deal with discretionary commission arrangement complaints (received after 17 November 2023) while it investigates. In effect this means while it encourages firms to progress complaints, they don't have to make any decisions just yet. The FCA originally expected to report on the findings of its investigation on 25 September 2024, but now they are intending to set out the next steps in May 2025."
"Heads up homeowners - Households set for cash boost as energy credit calls considered for Budget
Households are set for a potential €150 cash boost as the Government considers extending the reduced nine per cent VAT rate on energy bills in the 2025 budget, Finance Minister Jack Chambers has indicated.
With less than two months to go until the Coalition’s final Budget, new Finance Minister Jack Chambers last week said his budget will give workers and families a break, which could spell savings during the chillier months.
In recent budgets, the government slashed VAT on home heating gas and electric from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent, and in last year's Budget 2024 rolled out the reduced VAT for an extra year, with the current end date slated for 31 October 2024.

Thanks to the 12-month extension, it's estimated by the Department of Finance that consumers will shave off approximately €90 off their electricity bills, while gas users can expect to bag around €62 in savings.
Recent budgets have also included other measures to help households cope with skyrocketing energy bills with energy credits and cuts to taxes on electricity and gas.
Asked if the Government will extend the lower nine per cent VAT rate on electricity and gas to reduce energy bills, Minister Chambers told the Irish Sun that it is a measure they are considering for this winter.
He told the Irish Sun: “I fully understand that for many families the cost of living is still a central issue and despite the flash rate of inflation being at about 1.5 per cent in June and July, prices haven’t fallen for many families whether that’s in groceries, in energy or different price dynamics in our economy.
“That is why cost of living will be a central consideration in how we frame Budget 2025 and a part of that last year was the VAT reduction on energy – that will be considered in the context of Budget 2025 particularly during the winter period and how we can continue to support families during that time.”
Minister Chambers has a €1.4billion tax package that will be largely made up of significant cuts to income tax that will see lower and middle income earners keep more of their hard earned cash.

"Martin Lewis' MSE online letter that has saved people £3,300 in minutes
Several individuals have taken to the MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) members forum to share that they've received refunds from car finance providers after lodging a complaint using a template tool on the consumer group's website. The online tool was launched earlier this year by MSE founder Martin Lewis, following revelations that thousands could have been mis-sold hidden commissions on vehicles bought on finance.
Over two million people across the UK have utilised the online letter template, which prompts the car finance lender to investigate whether they have overcharged for their car loan through Discretionary Commission Arrangements (DCA) and are due a refund.
However, MSE has clarified that while some individuals have received these payments ""out of the blue"", they are not linked to the ongoing investigation being conducted by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Therefore, people can still use the online tool to lodge a complaint before any compensation decision is made next May.

One individual, Andrew, reached out to the MSE team via email, stating: ""I thought I would let you know that I put a claim into Motonovo the day your email template went live. I have just received £3,345 back In compensation.""
Mr_X shared his experience on the MSE Forum, saying: ""I wrote to Black Horse using MSE's reclaim tool about six months ago. I've only been getting acknowledgement emails from them every month or so. But out of nowhere, I've received a letter with a cheque for £269.91 from them. I can't work out if this is for my 'discretionary commission' enquiry or for something totally unrelated? "", reports the Daily Record.
Who could be in line for a refund?
Millions who have taken out finance for cars, vans, campervans, or motorcycles before 28 January 2021 might be entitled to a refund due to being charged 'hidden commission'. It's been reported that drivers could have paid around £1,100 more in interest on a £10,000 four-year car finance agreement under a Discretionary Commission Arrangement, with the potential refund amount increasing with the size of the loan.
The FCA declared last month that it would allow motor finance firms extra time to deal with customer complaints - now until the end of December next year - and anticipates making a decision on compensation for Discretionary Commission Arrangements by the end of May 2025.
At that time, Martin Lewis commented on the FCA's postponement, suggesting that ""indicates there's a chance that in May it will launch a consultation on a redress scheme"".
On social media, he clarified that this timeline was set because ""court will have decided on a key case by then and the move to December is so it'd be able to finish that consultation before firms have to put it in place"".
Martin stated: ""Clearly the delay is disappointing for those awaiting a decision, including the 2m who've submitted complaints via the MSE free tool. Yet it does signal it's still looking favourably on ruling it is mis-selling and a payout is due - even though the finance firms have been pushing back hard both publicly and through the courts.""
""Most important thing people can do is log their complaint ASAP, so that if there is a time bar, hopefully there's less chance of it being ruled out of time.""
Full details about using the online template tool can be found on MSE.com here."
